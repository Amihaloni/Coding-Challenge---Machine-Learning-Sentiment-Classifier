(source) - ie this game is an entire additional country of environmental damage for ~no useful gain\\nno one has found an actual use for any of it except for online drug dealing (which requires niche coins since Bitcoin is massive distributed public ledger)\\nthe level of market manipulation and accounting fraud by eg Tether (and now USD \\\"coin\\\" admitted lying about the backing) would normally send people to jail but has for some reason got a free pass\\nthe clueless marketing by fanboys who only hope to enrich themselves by creating another layer to the pyramid\\nthe endlessly stupid projects it has spawned where blockchain is seen as a solution to anything aside from the niche case of \\\"distributed tamper evident journal\\\"\\nit has single handedly made mass international ransomware a viable business model by allowing a way to receive cash outside the banking system\\nthe general enablement of all sorts of scams, e.g. the endless kids on this very subreddit promoting \\\"12% crypto savings accounts\\\"\\nIt isn't nearly as secure as people think it is. Any determined state actor could subvert the network.\\nDeflation isn't actually a good thing in a currency. It ultimately favours the wealthy who can hold and dont need to spend.\\nMining (proof of stake or work) allow the wealthy to invest in mining equipment to control or dominate the market.\\nUltimately, no government on earth is going to give up its monetary policy as that is a key lever of control.\\nessentially everyone involved at this point is just trying to hustle the next generation - any hope any of it would serve as a useful technological or financial system has gone)\\nthe massive mis-represnetaion of how bitcoin in particular works, despite claims, it does not offer any of the following:\\nanonymity - the entire blockchain is public and diligently recorded on millions of nodes\\ndistributed freedom - a small number of mining cartels control almost all the hash power and normal people use one of ten crypto currency exchanges for everything anyway\\nunencumbered transactions - it's comically slow and inefficient\\nconvenient purchases - wallets are unwieldly for normal people, no reversibility\\nstore of value - volatility is hilarious and all anyone cares about us BTC:USD\\nthings I do like about cryptocurrency:\\n\\nmonero is pretty clever\\nethereum smart contracts are pretty scifi\\nwatching people learn 5000 years of history of why we have banking regulation in a single decade has been fun\\nthere will be some massive financial catastrophes to watch that will mostly only harm people who did not read my previous list\\nthe earlier state of every single exchange either getting robbed or exit scamming their own fanboys was quite funny in retrospect\\n(thx to u/TwentyCharactersShor for some extra items).\\n\\nI used to just think cryptocurrency was a fun hack but a bad idea for the mainstream, but I'm now pretty convinced it should be banned purely on resource grounds, since it seems impossible to force the externalities to be addressed\\n\\nIt's possible that someone will invent a cryptocurrency that's efficient to a level that it's not morally reprehensible to use, but how would it take off? the existing cryptocurrency interests want bitcoin to succeed purely because they're the top of the pyramid and also selling the shovels and so now anything new has to compete aginst the real financial sector and the entrenched cryptocurrency players.\",\n          \"Bitcoin is a great hedge against inflation because demand is growing, fiat keeps printing, yet there are fewer BTC put into existence each year as it trends toward 0.\\n\\nIf you buy 1BTC now for $30K and held for ten years - 1BTC be a lot more scarce and $30k will be worth a lot less. The same way the stock market or any asset can be a hedge against inflation. It usually counts on you selling as inflation happens not during the fallout after - crypto preformed extremely well in the last two years during the run up of the (lagging) CPI.\\n\\nEthereum is a hedge against inflation because people spend $20-80 million for its blockspace each DAY. It mints $30M in new coins which get sold each day to people who want blockspace. Next year it will mint $3M new coins each day forever after, and I'm taking the bet people will pay even more for blockspace in the future (by L2 compression protocols that batch 1000s into 1). Blockspace is finate and demand is strong, it's been a good bet to make so far.\\n\\nHere's a great site to compare POW and POS Ethereum. Something like a 2000x energy reduction sometime this year.\\n\\nBitcoin mining is done on specialized hardware so the economics of that are a lot different than GPU mining, and very strongly incentivize the new development of clean power. IMO large corporations having access to ~$0 energy while selling it for a cost isn't sustainable for true decentralization but whatever, it keeps coal mines from being profitable too if the hashrate can be inexpensively high.\\nThe argument against it usually is that it allows existing mines to stay open longer by recycling their otherwise wasted energy into BTC which means they may not go bankrupt. That's still a step in the right direction compared to flaring it all into the sky though, and that BTC can be sent somewhere that has no power to create power (like oil is used).\\n\\nEvery 4 years the amount of new BTC minted per block is reduced by half, and the hashrate (security/difficulty to mine) is dependant on how many miners are trying to get the one block reward. That means if your costs 20K to mine a BTC that's worth 30K today, the next halving your costs will be 20K to receive 15K of BTC, and you would be forced to stop mining or find a cheaper alternative. If the price of BTC doubles than you are safe but (despite what btc maxis think) it can't double forever. It's a non-issue because it will solve itself. Ideally the costs from people buying blockspace (crypto fees) will be drastic enough to make up for today's prehalving inflation rate, which means a ton of POW being done to earn fees - but if today miners are already making the pivot to clean energy (and not by choice) I can't imagine in ~20 years it being any easier to use coal or otherwise.\\n\\nThe energy argument is a global one, picking just crypto is disingenuous because most people are completely ignorant about crypto so this is what they're taught.

       "      <td>Bitcoin is a great hedge against inflation because demand is growing, fiat keeps printing, yet there are fewer BTC put into existence each year as it trends toward 0.\\n\\nIf you buy 1BTC now for $30K and held for ten years - 1BTC be a lot more scarce and $30k will be worth a lot less. The same way the stock market or any asset can be a hedge against inflation. It usually counts on you selling as inflation happens not during the fallout after - crypto preformed extremely well in the last two years during the run up of the (lagging) CPI.\\n\\nEthereum is a hedge against inflation because people spend $20-80 million for its blockspace each DAY. It mints $30M in new coins which get sold each day to people who want blockspace. Next year it will mint $3M new coins each day forever after, and I'm taking the bet people will pay even more for blockspace in the future (by L2 compression protocols that batch 1000s into 1). Blockspace is finate and demand is strong, it's been a good bet to make so far.\\n\\nHere's a great site to compare POW and POS Ethereum. Something like a 2000x energy reduction sometime this year.\\n\\nBitcoin mining is done on specialized hardware so the economics of that are a lot different than GPU mining, and very strongly incentivize the new development of clean power. IMO large corporations having access to ~$0 energy while selling it for a cost isn't sustainable for true decentralization but whatever, it keeps coal mines from being profitable too if the hashrate can be inexpensively high.\\nThe argument against it usually is that it allows existing mines to stay open longer by recycling their otherwise wasted energy into BTC which means they may not go bankrupt. That's still a step in the right direction compared to flaring it all into the sky though, and that BTC can be sent somewhere that has no power to create power (like oil is used).\\n\\nEvery 4 years the amount of new BTC minted per block is reduced by half, and the hashrate (security/difficulty to mine) is dependant on how many miners are trying to get the one block reward. That means if your costs 20K to mine a BTC that's worth 30K today, the next halving your costs will be 20K to receive 15K of BTC, and you would be forced to stop mining or find a cheaper alternative. If the price of BTC doubles than you are safe but (despite what btc maxis think) it can't double forever. It's a non-issue because it will solve itself. Ideally the costs from people buying blockspace (crypto fees) will be drastic enough to make up for today's prehalving inflation rate, which means a ton of POW being done to earn fees - but if today miners are already making the pivot to clean energy (and not by choice) I can't imagine in ~20 years it being any easier to use coal or otherwise.\\n\\nThe energy argument is a global one, picking just crypto is disingenuous because most people are completely ignorant about crypto so this is what they're taught.

(source) - ie this game is an entire additional country of environmental damage for ~no useful gain\\nno one has found an actual use for any of it except for online drug dealing (which requires niche coins since Bitcoin is massive distributed public ledger)\\nthe level of market manipulation and accounting fraud by eg Tether (and now USD \"coin\" admitted lying about the backing) would normally send people to jail but has for some reason got a free pass\\nthe clueless marketing by fanboys who only hope to enrich themselves by creating another layer to the pyramid\\nthe endlessly stupid projects it has spawned where blockchain is seen as a solution to anything aside from the niche case of \"distributed tamper evident journal\"\\nit has single handedly made mass international ransomware a viable business model by allowing a way to receive cash outside the banking system\\nthe general enablement of all sorts of scams, e.g. the endless kids on this very subreddit promoting \"12% crypto savings accounts\"\\nIt isn't nearly as secure as people think it is. Any determined state actor could subvert the network.\\nDeflation isn't actually a good thing in a currency. It ultimately favours the wealthy who can hold and dont need to spend.\\nMining (proof of stake or work) allow the wealthy to invest in mining equipment to control or dominate the market.\\nUltimately, no government on earth is going to give up its monetary policy as that is a key lever of control.\\nessentially everyone involved at this point is just trying to hustle the next generation - any hope any of it would serve as a useful technological or financial system has gone)\\nthe massive mis-represnetaion of how bitcoin in particular works, despite claims, it does not offer any of the following:\\nanonymity - the entire blockchain is public and diligently recorded on millions of nodes\\ndistributed freedom - a small number of mining cartels control almost all the hash power and normal people use one of ten crypto currency exchanges for everything anyway\\nunencumbered transactions - it's comically slow and inefficient\\nconvenient purchases - wallets are unwieldly for normal people, no reversibility\\nstore of value - volatility is hilarious and all anyone cares about us BTC:USD\\nthings I do like about cryptocurrency:\\n\\nmonero is pretty clever\\nethereum smart contracts are pretty scifi\\nwatching people learn 5000 years of history of why we have banking regulation in a single decade has been fun\\nthere will be some massive financial catastrophes to watch that will mostly only harm people who did not read my previous list\\nthe earlier state of every single exchange either getting robbed or exit scamming their own fanboys was quite funny in retrospect\\n(thx to u/TwentyCharactersShor for some extra items).\\n\\nI used to just think cryptocurrency was a fun hack but a bad idea for the mainstream, but I'm now pretty convinced it should be banned purely on resource grounds, since it seems impossible to force the externalities to be addressed\\n\\nIt's possible that someone will invent a cryptocurrency that's efficient to a level that it's not morally reprehensible to use, but how would it take off? the existing cryptocurrency interests want bitcoin to succeed purely because they're the top of the pyramid and also selling the shovels and so now anything new has to compete aginst the real financial sector and the entrenched cryptocurrency players.</td>\n",

The same way the stock market or any asset can be a hedge against inflation. It usually counts on you selling as inflation happens not during the fallout after - crypto preformed extremely well in the last two years during the run up of the (lagging) CPI.\\n\\nEthereum is a hedge against inflation because people spend $20-80 million for its blockspace each DAY. It mints $30M in new coins which get sold each day to people who want blockspace. Next year it will mint $3M new coins each day forever after, and I'm taking the bet people will pay even more for blockspace in the future (by L2 compression protocols that batch 1000s into 1). Blockspace is finate and demand is strong, it's been a good bet to make so far.\\n\\nHere's a great site to compare POW and POS Ethereum. Something like a 2000x energy reduction sometime this year.\\n\\nBitcoin mining is done on specialized hardware so the economics of that are a lot different than GPU mining, and very strongly incentivize the new development of clean power. IMO large corporations having access to ~$0 energy while selling it for a cost isn't sustainable for true decentralization but whatever, it keeps coal mines from being profitable too if the hashrate can be inexpensively high.\\nThe argument against it usually is that it allows existing mines to stay open longer by recycling their otherwise wasted energy into BTC which means they may not go bankrupt. That's still a step in the right direction compared to flaring it all into the sky though, and that BTC can be sent somewhere that has no power to create power (like oil is used).\\n\\nEvery 4 years the amount of new BTC minted per block is reduced by half, and the hashrate (security/difficulty to mine) is dependant on how many miners are trying to get the one block reward. That means if your costs 20K to mine a BTC that's worth 30K today, the next halving your costs will be 20K to receive 15K of BTC, and you would be forced to stop mining or find a cheaper alternative. If the price of BTC doubles than you are safe but (despite what btc maxis think) it can't double forever. It's a non-issue because it will solve itself. Ideally the costs from people buying blockspace (crypto fees) will be drastic enough to make up for today's prehalving inflation rate, which means a ton of POW being done to earn fees - but if today miners are already making the pivot to clean energy (and not by choice) I can't imagine in ~20 years it being any easier to use coal or otherwise.\\n\\nThe energy argument is a global one, picking just crypto is disingenuous because most people are completely ignorant about crypto so this is what they're taught. BTC is a legitimate currency in multiple Countries, crypto is used all over the world in places that don't have banks or face real inflation (Argentina), I spend it on cards in shops with and online too, VISA is using it because it's cheaper/faster than their existing rails, so is Stripe for the same reason. Volitility means you buy at the price you deserve not the price told to you, if housing bounced up and down every 4y and you weren't forced into a $1M two bedroom home maybe you'd be okay with it?\\n\\nThere are real problems with crypto but none of the things you mentioned.\\n   \n",
       "77  why I don't like crypto, ethically, financially and technologically:\\n\\nproof of work mining (e.g. Bitcoin) wastes ungodly amounts of electricity (until the world is 100% renewables mining displaces more useful work and thus creates emissions) and computing capacity\\nproof of space is the same but for making the world a worse place by driving up storage costs for everybody\\ncoin speculation is a massive ponzi scheme and no crypto fan acknowledges this\\nthe e.g. bitcoin network throughput is ~dozens of qps which would merely be hilarious if it wasn't burning as much coal as Australia\\njust on pure waste: Bitcoin production is estimated to generate between 22 and 22.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, or between the levels produced by Jordan and Sri Lanka, a 2019 study in scientific journal Joule found. (source) - ie this game is an entire additional country of environmental damage for ~no useful gain\\nno one has found an actual use for any of it except for online drug dealing (which requires niche coins since Bitcoin is massive distributed public ledger)\\nthe level of market manipulation and accounting fraud by eg Tether (and now USD \"coin\" admitted lying about the backing) would normally send people to jail but has for some reason got a free pass\\nthe clueless marketing by fanboys who only hope to enrich themselves by creating another layer to the pyramid\\nthe endlessly stupid projects it has spawned where blockchain is seen as a solution to anything aside from the niche case of \"distributed tamper evident journal\"\\nit has single handedly made mass international ransomware a viable business model by allowing a way to receive cash outside the banking system\\nthe general enablement of all sorts of scams, e.g. the endless kids on this very subreddit promoting \"12% crypto savings accounts\"\\nIt isn't nearly as secure as people think it is. Any determined state actor could subvert the network.\\nDeflation isn't actually a good thing in a currency. It ultimately favours the wealthy who can hold and dont need to spend.\\nMining (proof of stake or work) allow the wealthy to invest in mining equipment to control or dominate the market.\\nUltimately, no government on earth is going to give up its monetary policy as that is a key lever of control.\\nessentially everyone involved at this point is just trying to hustle the next generation - any hope any of it would serve as a useful technological or financial system has gone)\\nthe massive mis-represnetaion of how bitcoin in particular works, despite claims, it does not offer any of the following:\\nanonymity - the entire blockchain is public and diligently recorded on millions of nodes\\ndistributed freedom - a small number of mining cartels control almost all the hash power and normal people use one of ten crypto currency exchanges for everything anyway\\nunencumbered transactions - it's comically slow and inefficient\\nconvenient purchases - wallets are unwieldly for normal people, no reversibility\\nstore of value - volatility is hilarious and all anyone cares about us BTC:USD\\nthings I do like about cryptocurrency:\\n\\nmonero is pretty clever\\nethereum smart contracts are pretty scifi\\nwatching people learn 5000 years of history of why we have banking regulation in a single decade has been fun\\nthere will be some massive financial catastrophes to watch that will mostly only harm people who did not read my previous list\\nthe earlier state of every single exchange either getting robbed or exit scamming their own fanboys was quite funny in retrospect\\n(thx to u/TwentyCharactersShor for some extra items).\\n\\nI used to just think cryptocurrency was a fun hack but a bad idea for the mainstream, but I'm now pretty convinced it should be banned purely on resource grounds, since it seems impossible to force the externalities to be addressed\\n\\nIt's possible that someone will invent a cryptocurrency that's efficient to a level that it's not morally reprehensible to use, but how would it take off? the existing cryptocurrency interests want bitcoin to succeed purely because they're the top of the pyramid and also selling the shovels and so now anything new has to compete aginst the real financial sector and the entrenched cryptocurrency players.   \n",

It's up about 1000X. Bitcoin's price continues to grow at a very rapid rate, long term average. You see, there were good reasons for Bitcoin's rapid rise. Most of those reasons still exist. In fact, today there are even more good reasons than there were 10 or 5 years ago. It is reasonable to expect the long term average growth rate of Bitcoin to stay very high for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nReal estate has significant holding costs (eg: taxes, maintenance, insurance, sometimes fees, interest). Real estate isn't very liquid, and it has extremely high transaction costs.\\n\\nUltimately, the price of real estate (and rents) is limited by incomes. For example, in the long run people can't pay more for mort./rent than they earn. Realistically, they might be able to afford 35 or 40 percent of their net income for \\\"a place to live\\\". Thus, real estate prices are limited by incomes, in the long run. Incomes tend to barely keep up with inflation.\\n\\nLooking at long term historical data, such as Case-Shiller, for popular real estate markets, we see, in fact, that real estate prices barely track the rate of inflation, especially when the significant holding costs are properly accounted for.\\n\\nBitcoin has no such limit. Bitcoin has no holding costs. Bitcoin is liquid. Bitcoin transactions are typically very little. Bitcoin's price has been more than doubling every year, long term average, and as mentioned before, can reasonably be expected to continues its rapid ascent.\\n\\nReal estate is currently in a bubble, as evidenced by the price-to-income ratios. The current bubble will pop, as the prior bubble eventually had to pop.\\n\\nReal estate is nailed down. Bitcoin can be taken with you to anywhere in the world. Real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes. Real estate can be confiscated.\\n\\nWhen the private keys are properly stored, Bitcoin cannot be confiscated.\\n\\nKnowing all this, a person would be a total idiot to purchase real estate instead of investing in Bitcoin.\\n\\nHaving said that, I do plan on eventually using a small fraction (about 10 or 15 percent) of my Bitcoin holdings to buy my dream home - and to pay for it with Bitcoin, but still end up sitting on a serious stack of sats.\\n\\nI have zero regrets for investing in Bitcoin instead of real estate, and I never will.\",\n          \"Bitcoin is a great hedge against inflation because demand is growing, fiat keeps printing, yet there are fewer BTC put into existence each year as it trends toward 0.\\n\\nIf you buy 1BTC now for $30K and held for ten years - 1BTC be a lot more scarce and $30k will be worth a lot less. The same way the stock market or any asset can be a hedge against inflation. It usually counts on you selling as inflation happens not during the fallout after - crypto preformed extremely well in the last two years during the run up of the (lagging) CPI.\\n\\nEthereum is a hedge against inflation because people spend $20-80 million for its blockspace each DAY. It mints $30M in new coins which get sold each day to people who want blockspace. Next year it will mint $3M new coins each day forever after, and I'm taking the bet people will pay even more for blockspace in the future (by L2 compression protocols that batch 1000s into 1). Blockspace is finate and demand is strong, it's been a good bet to make so far.\\n\\nHere's a great site to compare POW and POS Ethereum. Something like a 2000x energy reduction sometime this year.\\n\\nBitcoin mining is done on specialized hardware so the economics of that are a lot different than GPU mining, and very strongly incentivize the new development of clean power. IMO large corporations having access to ~$0 energy while selling it for a cost isn't sustainable for true decentralization but whatever, it keeps coal mines from being profitable too if the hashrate can be inexpensively high.\\nThe argument against it usually is that it allows existing mines to stay open longer by recycling their otherwise wasted energy into BTC which means they may not go bankrupt. That's still a step in the right direction compared to flaring it all into the sky though, and that BTC can be sent somewhere that has no power to create power (like oil is used).\\n\\nEvery 4 years the amount of new BTC minted per block is reduced by half, and the hashrate (security/difficulty to mine) is dependant on how many miners are trying to get the one block reward. That means if your costs 20K to mine a BTC that's worth 30K today, the next halving your costs will be 20K to receive 15K of BTC, and you would be forced to stop mining or find a cheaper alternative. If the price of BTC doubles than you are safe but (despite what btc maxis think) it can't double forever. It's a non-issue because it will solve itself. Ideally the costs from people buying blockspace (crypto fees) will be drastic enough to make up for today's prehalving inflation rate, which means a ton of POW being done to earn fees - but if today miners are already making the pivot to clean energy (and not by choice) I can't imagine in ~20 years it being any easier to use coal or otherwise.\\n\\nThe energy argument is a global one, picking just crypto is disingenuous because most people are completely ignorant about crypto so this is what they're taught. BTC is a legitimate currency in multiple Countries, crypto is used all over the world in places that don't have banks or face real inflation (Argentina), I spend it on cards in shops with and online too, VISA is using it because it's cheaper/faster than their existing rails, so is Stripe for the same reason. Volitility means you buy at the price you deserve not the price told to you, if housing bounced up and down every 4y and you weren't forced into a $1M two bedroom home maybe you'd be okay with it?\\n\\nThere are real problems with crypto but none of the things you mentioned.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Negative\",\n          \"Positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comment_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 150,\n        \"min\": 407,\n        \"max\": 701,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          701,\n          407\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"new_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prob\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.004469673622655916,\n        \"min\": 0.9899309873580933,\n        \"max\": 0.9990565180778503,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9986624717712402\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Next year it will mint $3M new coins each day forever after, and I'm taking the bet people will pay even more for blockspace in the future (by L2 compression protocols that batch 1000s into 1). Blockspace is finate and demand is strong, it's been a good bet to make so far.\\n\\nHere's a great site to compare POW and POS Ethereum. Something like a 2000x energy reduction sometime this year.\\n\\nBitcoin mining is done on specialized hardware so the economics of that are a lot different than GPU mining, and very strongly incentivize the new development of clean power. IMO large corporations having access to ~$0 energy while selling it for a cost isn't sustainable for true decentralization but whatever, it keeps coal mines from being profitable too if the hashrate can be inexpensively high.\\nThe argument against it usually is that it allows existing mines to stay open longer by recycling their otherwise wasted energy into BTC which means they may not go bankrupt. That's still a step in the right direction compared to flaring it all into the sky though, and that BTC can be sent somewhere that has no power to create power (like oil is used).\\n\\nEvery 4 years the amount of new BTC minted per block is reduced by half, and the hashrate (security/difficulty to mine) is dependant on how many miners are trying to get the one block reward. That means if your costs 20K to mine a BTC that's worth 30K today, the next halving your costs will be 20K to receive 15K of BTC, and you would be forced to stop mining or find a cheaper alternative. If the price of BTC doubles than you are safe but (despite what btc maxis think) it can't double forever. It's a non-issue because it will solve itself. Ideally the costs from people buying blockspace (crypto fees) will be drastic enough to make up for today's prehalving inflation rate, which means a ton of POW being done to earn fees - but if today miners are already making the pivot to clean energy (and not by choice) I can't imagine in ~20 years it being any easier to use coal or otherwise.\\n\\nThe energy argument is a global one, picking just crypto is disingenuous because most people are completely ignorant about crypto so this is what they're taught. BTC is a legitimate currency in multiple Countries, crypto is used all over the world in places that don't have banks or face real inflation (Argentina), I spend it on cards in shops with and online too, VISA is using it because it's cheaper/faster than their existing rails, so is Stripe for the same reason. Volitility means you buy at the price you deserve not the price told to you, if housing bounced up and down every 4y and you weren't forced into a $1M two bedroom home maybe you'd be okay with it?\\n\\nThere are real problems with crypto but none of the things you mentioned.\\n</td>\n",

But I don't care.\\n\\nAlgo is the most shilled coin on reddit. I am the unlucky one and took the bait and bought Algo because of the shill. I did the research and on paper everything looked great. Fast, secure, reliable. I have read a lot of articles, read whitepaper and bought Algo. But now after half a year of holding I have to say that it's really bad. And I'll tell you why. Keep in mind that I'm talking about the WHOLE ALGO ECOSYSTEM and not blockchain itself.\\n\\nDapps - like currently there are 5 or 6 daapps? This is a joke. Younger chains have hundreds of them but in algo ecosystem there are 5 or 6 dapps and they are working really bad (more about this in the next points. The chain being young is not an excuse because other chains have much more cool and usefull daaps. Algo dapps are using AVM (Algorand wirtual machine) so the adoption will be always slower and slower.\\n\\nDapps working like shit. Many of those daaps rely on a single source of truth that is Algoexplorer API. It has constant problems and because of that platforms like yieldly works like shit. November and December was horrible. There wasn't a single day without any issues.\\n\\nOfficial wallet... Sometimes is not working. Or not working correctly. It's too dependant on Algoexporer api and AWS.\\n\\nALGO is CENTRALIZED\\n\\nNo rewards for running own node\\n\\nYesterday the only Algorand DEX tinyman was compromised and hacked and all liquidity pools are gone.\\n\\nHorrible marketing.\\n\\nNo clear roadmap for 2022.\\n\\nUnfulfilled promises (example? about increasing TPS)\\n\\nA lot small ones like poor website (doesn't look professional) and poor communication with Algorand Foundation\\n\\nThe Algorand community on reddit is so toxic and blind. If the Algo price is increasing they are posting charts and yelling how awesome Algo is and the pump is incoming. When it's down they claim that it's just because of bitcoin? You get it? Algo UP - it's because algo is awesome? Algo down - because of bitcoin. They hate every other chain because only ALGORAND is the best.\\n\\nPoor price action comparing to other scalable solutions.\\n\\nOk some of you may disagree with some points but most of them are straigth facts.

       "      <td>Ten years ago, I put my down payment money into Bitcoin instead of real estate. It's up about 1000X. Bitcoin's price continues to grow at a very rapid rate, long term average. You see, there were good reasons for Bitcoin's rapid rise. Most of those reasons still exist. In fact, today there are even more good reasons than there were 10 or 5 years ago. It is reasonable to expect the long term average growth rate of Bitcoin to stay very high for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nReal estate has significant holding costs (eg: taxes, maintenance, insurance, sometimes fees, interest). Real estate isn't very liquid, and it has extremely high transaction costs.\\n\\nUltimately, the price of real estate (and rents) is limited by incomes. For example, in the long run people can't pay more for mort./rent than they earn. Realistically, they might be able to afford 35 or 40 percent of their net income for \"a place to live\". Thus, real estate prices are limited by incomes, in the long run. Incomes tend to barely keep up with inflation.\\n\\nLooking at long term historical data, such as Case-Shiller, for popular real estate markets, we see, in fact, that real estate prices barely track the rate of inflation, especially when the significant holding costs are properly accounted for.\\n\\nBitcoin has no such limit. Bitcoin has no holding costs. Bitcoin is liquid. Bitcoin transactions are typically very little. Bitcoin's price has been more than doubling every year, long term average, and as mentioned before, can reasonably be expected to continues its rapid ascent.\\n\\nReal estate is currently in a bubble, as evidenced by the price-to-income ratios. The current bubble will pop, as the prior bubble eventually had to pop.\\n\\nReal estate is nailed down. Bitcoin can be taken with you to anywhere in the world. Real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes. Real estate can be confiscated.\\n\\nWhen the private keys are properly stored, Bitcoin cannot be confiscated.\\n\\nKnowing all this, a person would be a total idiot to purchase real estate instead of investing in Bitcoin.\\n\\nHaving said that, I do plan on eventually using a small fraction (about 10 or 15 percent) of my Bitcoin holdings to buy my dream home - and to pay for it with Bitcoin, but still end up sitting on a serious stack of sats.\\n\\nI have zero regrets for investing in Bitcoin instead of real estate, and I never will.</td>\n",

The same way the stock market or any asset can be a hedge against inflation. It usually counts on you selling as inflation happens not during the fallout after - crypto preformed extremely well in the last two years during the run up of the (lagging) CPI.\\n\\nEthereum is a hedge against inflation because people spend $20-80 million for its blockspace each DAY. It mints $30M in new coins which get sold each day to people who want blockspace. Next year it will mint $3M new coins each day forever after, and I'm taking the bet people will pay even more for blockspace in the future (by L2 compression protocols that batch 1000s into 1). Blockspace is finate and demand is strong, it's been a good bet to make so far.\\n\\nHere's a great site to compare POW and POS Ethereum. Something like a 2000x energy reduction sometime this year.\\n\\nBitcoin mining is done on specialized hardware so the economics of that are a lot different than GPU mining, and very strongly incentivize the new development of clean power. IMO large corporations having access to ~$0 energy while selling it for a cost isn't sustainable for true decentralization but whatever, it keeps coal mines from being profitable too if the hashrate can be inexpensively high.\\nThe argument against it usually is that it allows existing mines to stay open longer by recycling their otherwise wasted energy into BTC which means they may not go bankrupt. That's still a step in the right direction compared to flaring it all into the sky though, and that BTC can be sent somewhere that has no power to create power (like oil is used).\\n\\nEvery 4 years the amount of new BTC minted per block is reduced by half, and the hashrate (security/difficulty to mine) is dependant on how many miners are trying to get the one block reward. That means if your costs 20K to mine a BTC that's worth 30K today, the next halving your costs will be 20K to receive 15K of BTC, and you would be forced to stop mining or find a cheaper alternative. If the price of BTC doubles than you are safe but (despite what btc maxis think) it can't double forever. It's a non-issue because it will solve itself. Ideally the costs from people buying blockspace (crypto fees) will be drastic enough to make up for today's prehalving inflation rate, which means a ton of POW being done to earn fees - but if today miners are already making the pivot to clean energy (and not by choice) I can't imagine in ~20 years it being any easier to use coal or otherwise.\\n\\nThe energy argument is a global one, picking just crypto is disingenuous because most people are completely ignorant about crypto so this is what they're taught. BTC is a legitimate currency in multiple Countries, crypto is used all over the world in places that don't have banks or face real inflation (Argentina), I spend it on cards in shops with and online too, VISA is using it because it's cheaper/faster than their existing rails, so is Stripe for the same reason. Volitility means you buy at the price you deserve not the price told to you, if housing bounced up and down every 4y and you weren't forced into a $1M two bedroom home maybe you'd be okay with it?\\n\\nThere are real problems with crypto but none of the things you mentioned.\\n   \n",
       "77   why I don't like crypto, ethically, financially and technologically:\\n\\nproof of work mining (e.g. Bitcoin) wastes ungodly amounts of electricity (until the world is 100% renewables mining displaces more useful work and thus creates emissions) and computing capacity\\nproof of space is the same but for making the world a worse place by driving up storage costs for everybody\\ncoin speculation is a massive ponzi scheme and no crypto fan acknowledges this\\nthe e.g. bitcoin network throughput is ~dozens of qps which would merely be hilarious if it wasn't burning as much coal as Australia\\njust on pure waste: Bitcoin production is estimated to generate between 22 and 22.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, or between the levels produced by Jordan and Sri Lanka, a 2019 study in scientific journal Joule found. (source) - ie this game is an entire additional country of environmental damage for ~no useful gain\\nno one has found an actual use for any of it except for online drug dealing (which requires niche coins since Bitcoin is massive distributed public ledger)\\nthe level of market manipulation and accounting fraud by eg Tether (and now USD \"coin\" admitted lying about the backing) would normally send people to jail but has for some reason got a free pass\\nthe clueless marketing by fanboys who only hope to enrich themselves by creating another layer to the pyramid\\nthe endlessly stupid projects it has spawned where blockchain is seen as a solution to anything aside from the niche case of \"distributed tamper evident journal\"\\nit has single handedly made mass international ransomware a viable business model by allowing a way to receive cash outside the banking system\\nthe general enablement of all sorts of scams, e.g. the endless kids on this very subreddit promoting \"12% crypto savings accounts\"\\nIt isn't nearly as secure as people think it is. Any determined state actor could subvert the network.\\nDeflation isn't actually a good thing in a currency. It ultimately favours the wealthy who can hold and dont need to spend.\\nMining (proof of stake or work) allow the wealthy to invest in mining equipment to control or dominate the market.\\nUltimately, no government on earth is going to give up its monetary policy as that is a key lever of control.\\nessentially everyone involved at this point is just trying to hustle the next generation - any hope any of it would serve as a useful technological or financial system has gone)\\nthe massive mis-represnetaion of how bitcoin in particular works, despite claims, it does not offer any of the following:\\nanonymity - the entire blockchain is public and diligently recorded on millions of nodes\\ndistributed freedom - a small number of mining cartels control almost all the hash power and normal people use one of ten crypto currency exchanges for everything anyway\\nunencumbered transactions - it's comically slow and inefficient\\nconvenient purchases - wallets are unwieldly for normal people, no reversibility\\nstore of value - volatility is hilarious and all anyone cares about us BTC:USD\\nthings I do like about cryptocurrency:\\n\\nmonero is pretty clever\\nethereum smart contracts are pretty scifi\\nwatching people learn 5000 years of history of why we have banking regulation in a single decade has been fun\\nthere will be some massive financial catastrophes to watch that will mostly only harm people who did not read my previous list\\nthe earlier state of every single exchange either getting robbed or exit scamming their own fanboys was quite funny in retrospect\\n(thx to u/TwentyCharactersShor for some extra items).\\n\\nI used to just think cryptocurrency was a fun hack but a bad idea for the mainstream, but I'm now pretty convinced it should be banned purely on resource grounds, since it seems impossible to force the externalities to be addressed\\n\\nIt's possible that someone will invent a cryptocurrency that's efficient to a level that it's not morally reprehensible to use, but how would it take off? the existing cryptocurrency interests want bitcoin to succeed purely because they're the top of the pyramid and also selling the shovels and so now anything new has to compete aginst the real financial sector and the entrenched cryptocurrency players.   \n",

But I don't care.\\n\\nAlgo is the most shilled coin on reddit. I am the unlucky one and took the bait and bought Algo because of the shill. I did the research and on paper everything looked great. Fast, secure, reliable. I have read a lot of articles, read whitepaper and bought Algo. But now after half a year of holding I have to say that it's really bad. And I'll tell you why. Keep in mind that I'm talking about the WHOLE ALGO ECOSYSTEM and not blockchain itself.\\n\\nDapps - like currently there are 5 or 6 daapps? This is a joke. Younger chains have hundreds of them but in algo ecosystem there are 5 or 6 dapps and they are working really bad (more about this in the next points. The chain being young is not an excuse because other chains have much more cool and usefull daaps. Algo dapps are using AVM (Algorand wirtual machine) so the adoption will be always slower and slower.\\n\\nDapps working like shit. Many of those daaps rely on a single source of truth that is Algoexplorer API. It has constant problems and because of that platforms like yieldly works like shit. November and December was horrible. There wasn't a single day without any issues.\\n\\nOfficial wallet... Sometimes is not working. Or not working correctly. It's too dependant on Algoexporer api and AWS.\\n\\nALGO is CENTRALIZED\\n\\nNo rewards for running own node\\n\\nYesterday the only Algorand DEX tinyman was compromised and hacked and all liquidity pools are gone.\\n\\nHorrible marketing.\\n\\nNo clear roadmap for 2022.\\n\\nUnfulfilled promises (example? about increasing TPS)\\n\\nA lot small ones like poor website (doesn't look professional) and poor communication with Algorand Foundation\\n\\nThe Algorand community on reddit is so toxic and blind. If the Algo price is increasing they are posting charts and yelling how awesome Algo is and the pump is incoming. When it's down they claim that it's just because of bitcoin? You get it? Algo UP - it's because algo is awesome? Algo down - because of bitcoin. They hate every other chain because only ALGORAND is the best.\\n\\nPoor price action comparing to other scalable solutions.\\n\\nOk some of you may disagree with some points but most of them are straigth facts. Please research about the recent Hack and algoexplorer problems.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for all rewards!   \n",

It's up about 1000X. Bitcoin's price continues to grow at a very rapid rate, long term average. You see, there were good reasons for Bitcoin's rapid rise. Most of those reasons still exist. In fact, today there are even more good reasons than there were 10 or 5 years ago. It is reasonable to expect the long term average growth rate of Bitcoin to stay very high for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nReal estate has significant holding costs (eg: taxes, maintenance, insurance, sometimes fees, interest). Real estate isn't very liquid, and it has extremely high transaction costs.\\n\\nUltimately, the price of real estate (and rents) is limited by incomes. For example, in the long run people can't pay more for mort./rent than they earn. Realistically, they might be able to afford 35 or 40 percent of their net income for \"a place to live\". Thus, real estate prices are limited by incomes, in the long run. Incomes tend to barely keep up with inflation.\\n\\nLooking at long term historical data, such as Case-Shiller, for popular real estate markets, we see, in fact, that real estate prices barely track the rate of inflation, especially when the significant holding costs are properly accounted for.\\n\\nBitcoin has no such limit. Bitcoin has no holding costs. Bitcoin is liquid. Bitcoin transactions are typically very little. Bitcoin's price has been more than doubling every year, long term average, and as mentioned before, can reasonably be expected to continues its rapid ascent.\\n\\nReal estate is currently in a bubble, as evidenced by the price-to-income ratios. The current bubble will pop, as the prior bubble eventually had to pop.\\n\\nReal estate is nailed down. Bitcoin can be taken with you to anywhere in the world. Real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes. Real estate can be confiscated.\\n\\nWhen the private keys are properly stored, Bitcoin cannot be confiscated.\\n\\nKnowing all this, a person would be a total idiot to purchase real estate instead of investing in Bitcoin.\\n\\nHaving said that, I do plan on eventually using a small fraction (about 10 or 15 percent) of my Bitcoin holdings to buy my dream home - and to pay for it with Bitcoin, but still end up sitting on a serious stack of sats.\\n\\nI have zero regrets for investing in Bitcoin instead of real estate, and I never will.   \n",

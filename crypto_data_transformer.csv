honestly after reading this post and many of the responses i have to conclude most of the cryptospace is totally fucked. the consept of crypto has been entirely lost waves of noobs arrive on crypto island and instead of revelling in the freedom do everything they can to plan their way to get back off of the island.,Negative

unpopular opinion crypto sucks criticism topic perspective banks suck but crypto aint much better. higly speculative and unstable. just as much bullshit as there is on wallstreet. leverage shorting futures longs market manipulation and what not. people gambling with their money. your keys arnt really safe what do you want to do implement a chip in your arm what if the chip breaks keep it digitally somewhere dig a hole in the ground most people keep it on centralised exchanges anyway. what if you die it wont go to your relatives it fucks with your mental and emotional state too because of the unstable nature of it. one day you think you have money the next day 20 is gone. people who buy early are basicly just taking other peoples investment when they sell. call it pyramid games. the space is flooding with scammers annoying shilling shouting idiots and and what not. bitcoin and the likes are highly energy inefficient. yes but look at the regular financial systems energy use you will say blah blah....this is like saying u can dump your plastic in the river because theres a plastic soup already in the ocean. yes here and there they use solar panels...well why not use them for more usefull things as they are costly to make. yes but proof of stake you will say yes...its basicly being kept in the air by people that are again....gambling with their money. all these companys cant they just build stuff without thousands of people throwing their money at them hoping they will get rich temselves. blockchains are cool in their decentralised way but all the speculation on top of it... while everyone is shouting at digital coins society remains a shithole. salaries are low for most people housing prices are still going through the roof. crypto wont safe us. wealthy people will get more wealthy at the cost of others and some might get lucky..the lucky few who are in it early and take other peoples money when they finally cash out. sorry for the rant but this is kind of how im starting to feel about the whole thing.,Negative

im super bullish on dot. my best hold imho. love the team love the tech and the ecosystem is growing at a nice pace. for instance ive been tinkering with parallel finance lately and i really like it. i think were going to see great things from polkadot in the future. good luck to all dot holders out there,Positive
yes. it is both actually good with a ton of solutions built on top of its blockchain and it has first mover advantage being the only player who offered smart contract functionality for a while. it of course has its drawbacks and limitations because duh its had to adapt on the go think etc and the idiots who still buy it but i wouldnt call it weak by any means. even with its stupidly expensive gas fees its a solid solution.,Positive
wow tron copied eth and is now copying tfls folly tron was labeled as a pile of poo coin by coinsider on yt. the founder of tron likes to steal ideas. looks like he stole the wrong one this time. whoever triggered usts death spiral can also trigger one for usdd. i am also predicting noncollateralized stable coins will be banned eventually.,Negative

laugh all you want but its practically inevitable that a crypto coin will take over as the world exchange currency. it would take a pretty big reversal at this point for it to not be bitcoin but i suppose its possible.,Positive
i didnt sell. luna my 900 dollars worth 0 now,Negative
the intrinsictrue value of all crypto is 0. thats not hyperbole thats just an objective fact about any virtual currency. i guess the same is true of fiat money too. in any big disaster scenario where society collapses its likely they would both become equally worthless pretty much immediately. even if the internet somehow continued running no one would be interested in your crypto. as soon as there is scarcity and insecurity on that scale physical goods are all that matters. its possible that gold could come into use but youd have to be confident that other people are interested in it before taking it yourself in an exchange because you may end up starving to death on a pile of shiny metal otherwise.,Negative
crypto gains depend on a greater fool to buy in after youve bought it. of course someone with 60 of their portfolio in bitcoin is going to shill it. the reality is that crypto has really only exploded so spectacularly is because speculation loves low interest rates and easy money and that has been the world we live in since the origin of bitcoin. as monetary policies tighten speculation shits the bed as is happening now.,Negative
the hype narrative of crypto constantly changes based on what the promoters need to push. they basically repeated the phrase over and over similar to propaganda. first it was a medium exchange. then they found out it was too slow and costly to be a medium of exchange. then it was an anonymous currency. governments came up with ways to track it and required exchanges to record info about their customers. then it was an uncorrelated asset. that didnt work out because it is highly correlated to the nasdaq. now it is digital gold a store of value and an inflation hedge. that isnt panning out either. i dont think anyone is surprised.,Negative

the ultimate gift to money launderers tax evaders and regimes circumventing sanctions. as if it wasnt easy enough already. pyramid schemes and other types of large scale fraud have never been quicker or easier. super easy to lose everything to phishing or an exploit. energy consumption of pow. a new avenue for gambling addicts to be created or suffer relapse. beyond the rug pulls and meme coins most projects are still massively inflated bubbles because the vast majority of buyers know shit about fuck and just want to get rich quick.,Negative
gonna buy the dip still,Positive
it became a religion akin to old religions. people defend their cointoken like it was their chosen greek god waging war against other gods. its honestly very interesting but also very cringe at the same time.,Negative
yes governments ban it. one major thing though is that the entire backbone of crypto liquidity is through a stable coin called tether. they are a complete scam and are already banned in ny. once the sec finds out that their coins which should be backed by one u.s. dollar are backed by nothing i believe the feds will shut down exchanges because it has become one huge ponzi scheme.,Negative
environmental impact bitcoin alone has the environmental impact co2 emissions of some small countries. for a currency that is primarily used for stored value not transactions this is incredibly problematic. assuming there will be no transformational breakthroughs in computing efficiency proof of work is going to be with us and obfuscating the long term value of crypto. httpsnews.climate.columbia.edu20210920bitcoinsimpactsonclimateandtheenvironment complexity my smart nontechy friend literally just put 40k into titans crypto fund because he didnt trust himself to not make a costly error in purchasing the coins i advised him on. hes in his early 30s and works for a tech company still not confident of transacting in the coins themselves. thats going to continue to be a problem of broad adoption. scammy coins this thread loves to shit on elizabeth warren for trying to regulate the crypto space i think her heart is in the right place but often gets the details wrong buuuuut if we want broad adoption we need zero news stories of people getting rug pulled hacked etc. regulation specifically around verification of project fundamentals would be incredibly valuable to giving consumers confidence in what theyre purchasing prevent people from being rug pulled and becoming a crypto detractor. littleedge case consumer utility self explanatory. until there are actual broad consumer market applications were all still rolling dice in a casino.,Negative
prolly going to get downvoted but its not. its 100 speculative. look at the top 100 largest businesses you can invest in around 2011 then look at cryptocurrencies. 80 of businesses from that era are still around.... look how many cryptocurrencies that were popular that are still known its less than 5 with higher risk comes higher reward but dont let that blind you from the fact that cryptocurrencies are the riskiest investment there is.,Negative

bitcoin offers billions of people around the world who dont have access to bank account a way to store spend and grow their wealth over time. as i gains adoption it will become less volatile due to the larger market cap and trading volume. if you look around the world today and dont think there is a huge need for decentralized and incorruptible money then im sure we disagree on a lot more then just btc.,Positive

bitcoin is a great hedge against inflation because demand is growing fiat keeps printing yet there are fewer btc put into existence each year as it trends toward 0. if you buy 1btc now for $30k and held for ten years 1btc be a lot more scarce and $30k will be worth a lot less. the same way the stock market or any asset can be a hedge against inflation. it usually counts on you selling as inflation happens not during the fallout after crypto preformed extremely well in the last two years during the run up of the lagging cpi. ethereum is a hedge against inflation because people spend $2080 million for its blockspace each day. it mints $30m in new coins which get sold each day to people who want blockspace. next year it will mint $3m new coins each day forever after and im taking the bet people will pay even more for blockspace in the future by l2 compression protocols that batch 1000s into 1. blockspace is finate and demand is strong its been a good bet to make so far. heres a great site to compare pow and pos ethereum. something like a 2000x energy reduction sometime this year. bitcoin mining is done on specialized hardware so the economics of that are a lot different than gpu mining and very strongly incentivize the new development of clean power. imo large corporations having access to $0 energy while selling it for a cost isnt sustainable for true decentralization but whatever it keeps coal mines from being profitable too if the hashrate can be inexpensively high. the argument against it usually is that it allows existing mines to stay open longer by recycling their otherwise wasted energy into btc which means they may not go bankrupt. thats still a step in the right direction compared to flaring it all into the sky though and that btc can be sent somewhere that has no power to create power like oil is used. every 4 years the amount of new btc minted per block is reduced by half and the hashrate securitydifficulty to mine is dependant on how many miners are trying to get the one block reward. that means if your costs 20k to mine a btc thats worth 30k today the next halving your costs will be 20k to receive 15k of btc and you would be forced to stop mining or find a cheaper alternative. if the price of btc doubles than you are safe but despite what btc maxis think it cant double forever. its a nonissue because it will solve itself. ideally the costs from people buying blockspace crypto fees will be drastic enough to make up for todays prehalving inflation rate which means a ton of pow being done to earn fees but if today miners are already making the pivot to clean energy and not by choice i cant imagine in 20 years it being any easier to use coal or otherwise. the energy argument is a global one picking just crypto is disingenuous because most people are completely ignorant about crypto so this is what theyre taught. btc is a legitimate currency in multiple countries crypto is used all over the world in places that dont have banks or face real inflation argentina i spend it on cards in shops with and online too visa is using it because its cheaperfaster than their existing rails so is stripe for the same reason. volitility means you buy at the price you deserve not the price told to you if housing bounced up and down every 4y and you werent forced into a $1m two bedroom home maybe youd be okay with it there are real problems with crypto but none of the things you mentioned.,Positive
i thought it was a store of value....whered the value go btc does nothing now.,Negative
i bought at 64k and 37k. if it drops to 29k im buying other bag. im just glad im finally getting a nice bag of btc. its about time.,Positive
the hype around nft collectibles is a very very bad thing. why someone would throw down thousands or even hundreds of thousands on a jpeg monkey that looks exactly like five thousand other jpeg monkeys except with different color teeth is beyond me. the current nft market is a giant bubble ready to burst. when it does it will punish those who create nfts that are actually unique and artistic rather than just being randomly generated modifications of the same image.,Negative
bitcoin is a lot of things right now. its a doomsday currency its an inflation hedge its a speculative asset its central banking hedge its a technology play plus hundred more things. all of things are components of its price and value. people buy sell and hold for different reasons. you cant look at it and say why is it dropping due to inflation its a hedge against inflation. also you cant say its a hedge against central banks because monetary policy and central banks is in probably one of the worst spots its been in a while. yet btc isnt at an all time high. btc is wearing many hats right now dont let anyone tell you its not any one of a number of different things.,Positive

bitcoin literally produces security. on the order of 180000 times greater than the worlds fastest supercomputer.,Positive
the ethereum ecosystem has more developers not just than any competitor it has more devs than every other smart contract platform combined excluding bitcoin it has more devs than every other crypto combined. the result of all those developers is innovation. every advance in defi has happened first on ethereum other chains have their own dapps but they are almost exclusively clones of things that were developed first in ethereum. the amount of value locked in defi just on mainmet is double that on every other chain combined.,Positive

this is great news for those who truly understand btc however for those who dont get it i expect them to laugh at me. it is all good because i am not worried one bit at all. i have no respect for volatility and i love fud. these are great times to buy more btc and eth. very simple no brain all stomach and i will wait it out with ease. bring on more bad news bring on more blood bring on more negative sentiment. nothing has changed fundamentally about btc and eth.,Positive
its not safe. we could lose 50 this week and take years to recover. or it could take a month. heck we just had a 20 drop. usually when people say safe they are referring to lack of volatility. consistent returns and limited losses. crypto most definitely is not that.,Negative

i have a friend in crypto who made a lot of money. to this date still doesnt own a home. reason why and this is a quote i want to have my money when i need it bitcoin one click of a button you have your cash. a house can be more difficult to sell. even when markets are high it can takes months to sell a house. i think 5001000$ a month is great to get into bitcoin. you will learn the patterns and odds are btc will cross 100k in the next bull run following the 2024 halving. if you can stack 12 btc your looking at 100200k off of investing 1040k depending on what bitcoin prices are in the current bear market. we might see sub 20k prices soon.,Positive

why i dont like crypto ethically financially and technologically proof of work mining e.g. bitcoin wastes ungodly amounts of electricity until the world is 100 renewables mining displaces more useful work and thus creates emissions and computing capacity proof of space is the same but for making the world a worse place by driving up storage costs for everybody coin speculation is a massive ponzi scheme and no crypto fan acknowledges this the e.g. bitcoin network throughput is dozens of qps which would merely be hilarious if it wasnt burning as much coal as australia just on pure waste bitcoin production is estimated to generate between 22 and 22.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year or between the levels produced by jordan and sri lanka a 2019 study in scientific journal joule found. source ie this game is an entire additional country of environmental damage for no useful gain no one has found an actual use for any of it except for online drug dealing which requires niche coins since bitcoin is massive distributed public ledger the level of market manipulation and accounting fraud by eg tether and now usd coin admitted lying about the backing would normally send people to jail but has for some reason got a free pass the clueless marketing by fanboys who only hope to enrich themselves by creating another layer to the pyramid the endlessly stupid projects it has spawned where blockchain is seen as a solution to anything aside from the niche case of distributed tamper evident journal it has single handedly made mass international ransomware a viable business model by allowing a way to receive cash outside the banking system the general enablement of all sorts of scams e.g. the endless kids on this very subreddit promoting 12 crypto savings accounts it isnt nearly as secure as people think it is. any determined state actor could subvert the network. deflation isnt actually a good thing in a currency. it ultimately favours the wealthy who can hold and dont need to spend. mining proof of stake or work allow the wealthy to invest in mining equipment to control or dominate the market. ultimately no government on earth is going to give up its monetary policy as that is a key lever of control. essentially everyone involved at this point is just trying to hustle the next generation any hope any of it would serve as a useful technological or financial system has gone the massive misrepresnetaion of how bitcoin in particular works despite claims it does not offer any of the following anonymity the entire blockchain is public and diligently recorded on millions of nodes distributed freedom a small number of mining cartels control almost all the hash power and normal people use one of ten crypto currency exchanges for everything anyway unencumbered transactions its comically slow and inefficient convenient purchases wallets are unwieldly for normal people no reversibility store of value volatility is hilarious and all anyone cares about us btcusd things i do like about cryptocurrency monero is pretty clever ethereum smart contracts are pretty scifi watching people learn 5000 years of history of why we have banking regulation in a single decade has been fun there will be some massive financial catastrophes to watch that will mostly only harm people who did not read my previous list the earlier state of every single exchange either getting robbed or exit scamming their own fanboys was quite funny in retrospect thx to utwentycharactersshor for some extra items. i used to just think cryptocurrency was a fun hack but a bad idea for the mainstream but im now pretty convinced it should be banned purely on resource grounds since it seems impossible to force the externalities to be addressed its possible that someone will invent a cryptocurrency thats efficient to a level that its not morally reprehensible to use but how would it take off the existing cryptocurrency interests want bitcoin to succeed purely because theyre the top of the pyramid and also selling the shovels and so now anything new has to compete aginst the real financial sector and the entrenched cryptocurrency players.,Negative
if demand for bitcoin goes up it logically starts replacing fiat currencies more and maybe one day its global reserve.,Positive
you gotta think a few years out with cro. its still early,Positive
if going long term btc and eth are the coins to buy imo,Positive
it isnt an investment its speculation in a ponzi scheme. theres no underlying business generating profit and no assets that can appreciate. the only reason for the price to rise is that in future somebody else sees the price rising and wants to speculate that it will keep rising. which is self fulfilling until it isnt.,Negative

i am yet to see any useful use case come out of crypto that cant be done without it easily. people will jump on decentralization but it wont remain decentralized its already getting more and more centralized. governments will never let it be a happyplaygroundforcryptobros so that point is already dead. aside from that its basically useless.,Negative
people dont want to accept that crypto is a seriously risky and speculative asset arguably one of the most speculative because there is absolutely 0 metrics that set a floor on the price there are no revenue there is no eps there are no buildings or machines or ip that have a hard value there is nothing to weigh and look at to say holy fuck this is very undervalued right now i should buy....the only thing propping up crypto prices is feels and all this money is coming out of the same bucket because crypto isnt a closed loop meaning you dont get paid in crypto and transact in crypto directly you have to buy it with fiat and when you buy something with it the vendor then has to exchange it back to fiat for it to have any real use for them because its not a medium of exchange excepton the very razors edge of the margin.... as the economy gets worse and prices keep going up people simply have less money so you are going to have a lot more sellers than buyers willing to put their fiat into the riskiest of assets when they have to pay 50 more for food and gas and might lose their job soon. this is what happens every downturn people flee risky speculative assets man shrugging its going to get worse we havent really seen any layoffs yet but its going to happen....crypto is really going to take a shit when that happens because again all the money is coming from the same bucket my point is that crypto markets will never decouple from the wider financial markets thats a complete pipe dream imo,Negative
what is dead may never die bitcoin has been declared dead like 400 times it always comes back.,Positive
such negativity. bitcoin has held up well. it often trades with the nasdaq simply because traders trade but there are times of divergence. it has outperformed a bearish nasdaq this year so it is hedging. its not a magical hedge.. but its a very strong unhacked financial network with a finite supply. btc dominance over other crypto has been rising again. as runaway inflation weakens fiat naturally btc will hedge to a degree. it has historically been more volatile though so you cant depend on it as a short term hedges.,Positive

i like the original digital gold you know bitcoin.,Positive
personally i invest in btc and eth. reason diversification. if the trend of getting everything online and the whole metaverse thingy continues then gains will also continue. the rate of adoption is increasing consistently. eth is a whole new ecosystem with insane amount of applications. sure other better crypto could replace it but so could a better search engine replace google and yet im not too worried about that. btc is the first real moneypropertystore of value whatever you want to call it which gives you complete control is decentralised and predictable you can see the code.,Positive
if you buy luna 2.0 you deserve to be in financial ruin. these guys are pure fraudsters,Negative
bitcoin does not need the approval of politicians. bitcoin is the peoples currency supported by the people. its existence is made legal by the choice of the people. politicians derive their power from the people and will have to accept the will of the people. that is the way it is.,Positive
yeah that could be a correct statement though that this sub has the worst analysis. but except analysis bitcoin has a real value over the crypto currency and people thus love it no matter how much percentage it gets down,Positive
axie will fail because its just a mediocre game coin and there are far more game companies that make better games. mana because have you actually experienced decentraland its buggy and there are better tech companies that can create so much better stable metaverse than mana.,Negative
crypto is an immature market with a high degree of volatility. with traditional investments you can hold for growth or you can day trade. 90 of people hold and even some of that 10 remaining probably shouldnt be day trading. with crypto there is no meaningful average return and this means that crypto is very difficult to fit within any accepted investment strategy.,Negative

dca is only reason i dont care if price drops anymore. just getting more for less. ill take it.,Positive
crypto is very high risk investment and i wouldnt reccomend it to anybody. there is hundreds of crypto created for sole purpose of attractic investors who will pump it and devs or people promoting will just cash out leaving everybody else in the loss. there is no reason at all for crypto going up but plenty of opportunities to get burned.,Negative

id love to see cryptocurrency regulated out of existence. its a black plague on humanity literally its a carbon producing monster that we desperately need to crush we also need to stop a lot of the other carbon producing industries too like oil and gas. but unfortunately our world cant function super well without gasoil right now. but we can function without cryptocurrency and have been for thousands of years. its literally called being patient and waiting another day or two for funds to settle. not to mention cryptocurrency is absolutely filled with scams. and the technology blockchain is outdated and stupid. literally a unchangeable linked list any programmer worth their salt can see that its basically useless old technology. it has some very tiny niche uses which largely most corporations and governments dont need it. and certainly they dont need a cryptocurrency. maybe one day it wont exist anymore. i can dream.,Negative

algo is garbage im explaining why conarguments im totally aware that this will be probably the most downvoted post in the history of this sub. but i dont care. algo is the most shilled coin on reddit. i am the unlucky one and took the bait and bought algo because of the shill. i did the research and on paper everything looked great. fast secure reliable. i have read a lot of articles read whitepaper and bought algo. but now after half a year of holding i have to say that its really bad. and ill tell you why. keep in mind that im talking about the whole algo ecosystem and not blockchain itself. dapps like currently there are 5 or 6 daapps this is a joke. younger chains have hundreds of them but in algo ecosystem there are 5 or 6 dapps and they are working really bad more about this in the next points. the chain being young is not an excuse because other chains have much more cool and usefull daaps. algo dapps are using avm algorand wirtual machine so the adoption will be always slower and slower. dapps working like shit. many of those daaps rely on a single source of truth that is algoexplorer api. it has constant problems and because of that platforms like yieldly works like shit. november and december was horrible. there wasnt a single day without any issues. official wallet... sometimes is not working. or not working correctly. its too dependant on algoexporer api and aws. algo is centralized no rewards for running own node yesterday the only algorand dex tinyman was compromised and hacked and all liquidity pools are gone. horrible marketing. no clear roadmap for 2022. unfulfilled promises example about increasing tps a lot small ones like poor website doesnt look professional and poor communication with algorand foundation the algorand community on reddit is so toxic and blind. if the algo price is increasing they are posting charts and yelling how awesome algo is and the pump is incoming. when its down they claim that its just because of bitcoin you get it algo up its because algo is awesome algo down because of bitcoin. they hate every other chain because only algorand is the best. poor price action comparing to other scalable solutions. ok some of you may disagree with some points but most of them are straigth facts. please research about the recent hack and algoexplorer problems. edit thanks for all rewards,Negative

its the community and the tech. the tech enables developers to build powerful applications. the large community of developers building apps attracts the large community of users using them. the large community of users attracts developers to build apps which attracts users...and so on and so on. communities and networks are difficult to reproduce and migrate. this is why the most successful alternative chains have bridges to ethereum and are compatible with the evm so that all the same apps and tools also work on their network. ethereum is at the center of all of this.,Positive

the entire crypto space is just full of morons tbh.,Negative
honestly the most attractive thing to me about crypto has been how it has literally paid me to learn shit. ive got a half dozen degrees diplomas and certifications in a couple of really different fields. i love learning clearly. everything i studied was in the pursuit of career opportunities because i also love making a comfortable living. but i paid to learn all that stuff. i put in time and money for a delayed payoff. crypto it actively pays me to be learning about macroeconomics finance infrastructure coding politics sociology gaming art marketing...,Positive
this is the way. until the ride back up go outside enjoy a hobby and keep onnnn buyin. well be wishing for the cheap days like these soon enough.,Positive
well 95 of crypto are shitcoins and scam coins.....,Negative
thismachinegreens.com bitcoin mining consumes energy and produces zero emissions. from an energy perspective there is no difference between a bitcoin miner and any other server in a datacenter. christmas lights consume energy and produce zero emissions also. some people choose to mine bitcoin in the same way some people choose to put up christmas lights every year. christmas lights consume more energy than the entire bitcoin network but we dont read articles about environmental concern around christmas lights.,Positive
im also very excited for when ethereum moves from pow to pos. that should remove the greatest criticism as several studies estimate a reduction of around 99.5 in energy costs. furthermore eth is working hard towards improving its transaction rate which it will need if it wants to challenge the likes of visa or mastercard which process orders of magnitude more transactions ps.,Positive
the funny thing is that people have already added more liquidity. you can see on algo explorer that folks have already put some money in to your shid coin unless those are other wallets youre associated with. which is to say case in point. people will buy pile of poo even if its labeled very clearly on the packaging and smells very much like pile of poo .,Negative
xlm having a relatively stable price is a good thing it makes it a better currency than most other cryptocurrencies.,Positive
allways wanted to invest money in to stoks but it is unnecessary complicated and expensive plus the returns you get with stoks are most often just inflation. crypto has everything it is accessible it is cheap it can return huge gains it operates 247 and i know a thing or two about technology,Positive
link is good and cheap right now. ive been increasing my chain link position lately,Positive
you think bitcoin will keep rising with an infinite percentage one day it will crash and stay down noob,Negative
bitcoin is a hedge against bank bailouts its literally in the genisis block. bitcoin is a hedge against the entire financial system from central banks to commercial banks. 99 of people will not buy bitcoin to hedge run away inflation. but 99 of people will buy bitcoin when their bank collapses their credit card stops working and their grocery store accepts lightning payments.,Positive
havent been in a while but the last time i visited rterraluna it was completely overrun by these detached moonbois. yet only a few pages further were people contemplating suicide. mind boggling,Negative
bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market has weathered an unbelievable amount of fud for around ten years guess what its still here and some of its biggest critics are now embracing the tech the impact blockchain tech will have on stuff like web 3.0 decentralised ai supply chain defi to name a few is immense.......to compare the market to tulips is just wilful ignorance.,Positive
theres no winning with this unless youre extremely lucky. pure gambling.,Negative
just look at safemoon. its not even speculation that the dev team are scammers... its been 100 proven through their code... and yet these people cling to the hope of getting rich. haha humans are just mostly fucking stupid creatures.,Negative
eth has the most development going on and thats ultimately more important than the blockchain itself. but its not useable by most people right now. its not a finished product. no crypto can really justify its market cap with performance at this point. thats why people say were still early there is speculative value placed on cryptos that may or may not pan out. with the eth 2.0 roadmap eth has the best chance to be scalable and developer friendly.,Positive
whenever i feel stupid and incapable of doing anything in life i just take a look into the crypto space lol.,Negative
it has been my defacto gold stable for 2.5 years now and i am really pleased with it. i tested their exchange mechanism and picked up some gold to verify the tokens being burned in that process.,Positive
stay away from luna scam 2.0,Negative
yup. still mega bullish on dots canary chain kusama also.,Positive
ethereum is the future. people fud because they missed the boat or want to buy in cheap.,Positive
like traditional gold it lacks intrinsic value it doesnt produce anything or create cash flow and almost nobody seems to fully grasp how it works. the underlying blockchain technology might prove to be tremendously valuable. but at this point its difficult to see why any one type of digital coin should be considered so valuable without much obvious nonillicit utility.,Negative
i really doubt its this deep. im assuming his fans are just greedy hopeful people. and do kwon knows how greedy people are in the crypto space and he knows even if he fucks up once he can do it again a few times. its like trust means nothing anymore if you can make them money.,Negative
too much garbage surrounding this coin the community and do kwon..this is not smart investingthis coin sucks even if you make money off it this coin sucks and it is really really weird to watch,Negative
rollercoasters go back up this is what you call the view from halfway down,Positive
money mate. were all here for the money.. but at some point youll just have to love the tech and upgrades offered. looking at deip and how they aim to tokenize intangible assets bringing em onchain. its an interesting move for defi as a whole..,Positive
if terra 2.0 doesnt have the algorithmic stablecoin then its literally completely useless and youd have to be a moron to buy some. you are aware that the algorithmic stablecoin is 100 of the value proposal of terra,Negative

its going on sale im gonna get so fat on bitcoin that when i sell it people are going to call me a whale,Positive
no one has convinced me that crypto as an investment is anything other than a ponzi scheme. i can see the utility of it as a currency i dont think its great as that either. the question i ask is what about the useful features supports the current price,Negative
crypto is giving us an avenue to not just be passengers in the financial world.,Positive

so many things destroy this planet faster than bitcoin mining. but we dont hear about it. crypto uses a little bit more energy and everybody is up with pitchforks,Positive
ever since i read literature about blockchain tech and web3 potential i am now at 25 crypto exposure. i might or might not be brainwashed by those reads but i assessed my risk and have the conviction that blockchain as tech is here to stay dont really care about it being a currency that is not coming anytime soon tbh.,Positive
every coin outside of bitcoin and ethereum was invented solely to make its creators rich. why would this one be any different,Negative
just hold your bag and have an exit strategy the good thing about this new proposal is that you dont need to changes to implement the burn for this new one the code is already written just needs the community to approve it and so far 93 have voted yes.,Positive
well even the newer investors can say they have experienced a crypto crash now. that that dont kill ya can only make you stronger. but like the last one and before that it will find its way back. hold relax enjoy life and buy more when you can is my philosophy. victory hand,Positive
this is why im bullish on ethereum. even if l2 projects wont be built ethereum they still rely on it as an l1 for both its infrastructure and security. i dont think eth going anywhere anytime soon.,Positive
love it. the tech is just so damn cool mixed with all of our current and upcoming technologies. its gonna continue to be a wild ride.,Positive
i just started playing with it but it seems great so far. i also love the idea of getting their coin before its listed anywhere. i believe it can do great.,Positive
btc is fairly analogous to gold. no intrinsic value proof of work gradual supply but limited total amount. however btc has several advantages instant transfer doesnt need expensive physical storage decentralised anonymous and the blockchain provides an indisputable ledger. i was the same as many people here bitcoin seemed like a nonsense but when you start looking at it as a replacement for gold its difficult to fault it. i really feel like its inevitable that it replaces gold as a store of wealth in the long term. comparing it to shares is not the way to look at it although i dont think share prices is always based on tangible fundamentals,Positive
note this only applies if you think it goes up. if you invested in a shitty project 99 of them its most likely not going up ever again you just lost.,Negative
bitcoin is many things. its compared more to the function of gold in relation to gold being the foundation and beginning of fiat. fiat was created because it was easier to transact with than literally gold. gold became a denominator of the value of fiat. the problem is that through corruption and human error there is no longer any way to verify the supply of fiat and gold printing fiat and mixing gold with other things and bad bookkeeping then theres bitcoin. imagine the same story but instead of gold fiat being backed by btc. a verifiable limited infinitely divisible asset that is mined through proof of work like gold bitcoin is also easier to transact with directly compared to literal gold. this is why people consider it as a possible currency. if the goldfiat supply was trusted then you also wouldnt transact with your precious gold. thats what fiat is for. same with btc. hold btc spend fiat. truth is bitcoin is many things. store of value digital energy because unusable electricity can be used to mine bitcoin transactable medium currency a collectible because its limited and supply gets lower everytime somebody loses their btc wallet keys btc beats gold. btc beats fiat. its more scarce than gold easy to transfer across the world noncorruptible decentralized verifiable. its an alternative to our current fiatgold standard and the only missing component is adoption.,Positive

a brand new shitcoin to buy monkey pictures.,Negative
crypto have taught me ethics and economic culture how to control emotions and stuffs taught me to be diligent to learning also and thats why im learning muse before investing in though its looking promising..,Positive
because he doesnt understand bitcoin. there is bitcoin as an asset there is bitcoin as a payment network. the payment network alone operate more efficiently with less fee than companies like western union. it also is more secure and transparent than swift. buffer should ask himself how much went into developing swift and thats pretty much the cost basis of bitcoin as a payment network. bitcoin is like fiat except it is more neutral and universal than majority of fiat out there.,Positive
the best thing about crypto i earn more per week staking than i did for the last 5 years of interest the bank was giving me combined. banks are literally robbing people of their money they are running one of the most successful scams in the world.,Positive
yeah pretty much this. other blockchains definitely have improved technology kudos to their devs but eth has so many brilliant or excited people working on it. at least 100x the number of devs and that might be conservative. so etheruem and layer2s on ethereum are likely here to stay for some time and be a proving ground testing ground for things for a while. it does not mean that other things are not going to thrive quite the contrary. just dont expect ethereum to suddenly become null anytime soon,Positive
im immediately cashing out every red cent as soon as i can. the fact that hes doing this and not fully reimbursing his victims is enough to lose confidence. the fact that confidence matters is enough to lose confidence. its a con,Negative

i agree. this is why i am holding most of my crypto in coins i believe in and use. coins with promissing technology.,Positive
btc eth ltc algo. solid starting place.,Positive
to be fair a guy on this sub made a guide on how to make a shitcoin and literally called it buttcoin and it pumped. so im not surprised at this point.,Negative
youre defending a pile of shitcoin with a postitnote that says dollar as being a legitimate asset tracked to the dollar. no its a shitcoin in disguise. thats why the peg didnt hold.,Negative
at this pace he will own 100 of the coins and they will worth nothing.,Negative
algo isnt going away. never had problems with it and a fixed transaction fee thats absolutely tiny is mega useful.,Positive
well i fully believe crypto is here to stay so im happy i can increase my position on btc and eth,Positive
bitcoin is more like natural dmt floating in your brain everyone has the possibility to access it without cost. you process it read it understand it then define it without any middlemen. they can slow it down they cant stop the flow,Positive
elon was the reason doge was on a perpetual dip since his snl appearance.,Negative
how many times do people have to get burned before they learn not to trust this guy,Negative
the problem though is a lot of people dont think cryptos are riskier than stocks. i see so much rhetoric about how bitcoin and similar is only going to go up and easily 10x over the coming years. it unfortunately seems to be the less informed educated about investing that have just seen the influencers on tiktok youtube reddit etc... they see this as their ticket to riches and you will be kicking yourself in 10 years time if you dont take advantage now. if you try and speak to them rationally to think through what they are saying they just shout that its fud and ignore it. most cryptos are net negative the only value in them is what people put in minus the fees the people running the platforms miners dev wallets founders selling excess tokens etc are taking out so its impossible for every investor to get back the money they put in. there will always be someone left holding the bag.,Negative
whatever the case im still bullish i failed to be a part of btc when it first kicked off. id have been a millionaire if i did im not making that mistake again. at this point im converting other holdings like shiryo to dca some more.,Positive
its really good most secure and most decentralized chain. other projects might look good because they sacrifice decentralization for scalability which is useful for a lot of people until it isnt.,Positive
i dont have the money to invest in it but i do think crypto has longevity.,Positive
i think its smart to hold both. if you are still buying altcoins at the moment i guess cosmos is the smart buy since it recently got ravaged by lunaust and already had a lower market cap than dot. not financial advice despite appearing to be exactly that.,Positive
given that crypto is fundamentally deflationary and limited in supply it makes for a terrible currency. currencys purpose is not be an investment but to facilitate trade. deflationary currencies always gain value due to limited supply which means people will just sit on them instead of transacting with them. inflationary currencies on the other hand incentivize people to use them for goods or investments as they are actively losing value.,Negative
i prefer gold investment trading.,Negative
i do not feel sorry for anyone who got into ponzikwon ii,Negative
the total lack of intrinsic value. if youre buying commodities or currency backed by a countries economy there will always be some intrinsic value so during times of low value you can hang onto your investment and wait out the storm. a crypto investment could go up in smoke and you could lose everything.,Negative
lets call it what it is. a scam rugpull and ponzi scheme,Negative
i hate dogecoin because of its fanbase. discussion i had nothing against dogecoin. to be honest i liked it because it was the most popular meme coin these last years and the community seemed really cool until elon musk started to talk about it at least thats why i think it became so annoying. every post involving crypto in some cases not even involving it especially posts by elon musk there are these people spamming dumb shit about this doggy coin. one of the most famous figures ive noticed is matt wallece. just take a look at his tweets history and you will understand what im saying and he is just one of them. im annoyed of dogecoin because of these people. how can your life be resumed by convincing people all the time that theres a crypto out there that is worth paying for edit yeah hate is a strong word. i dont hate it but im sick of reading dogecoin everywhere.,Negative
this is wrong. not only companies can engage in ponzi schemes. btc has proven that this can also be a collective of people promoting and pushing the price only for their profit. investors in btc can only gain by the loss of others,Negative
unbelievable. i lost $2k to do kwon which was a third of my whole portfolio and for me a lot of money. unamused face im really done with this guy. face with rolling eyes,Negative
this is the way. buy low...buy high... the only time i sell is when i spend it on something lol.,Positive
banned for going it is a ponzi and not going well acgtually it is a distributed decentralized mlm scheme shilling a centralized database which is stored in a decentralized matter on which people can only write via a convoluted decrentralized way. which due to negative sum nature of the mechanisms leads to the scheme needing and ever increasing supply of fiat electronics and power or it will collapse. this system also benefitsthe people who bought in early ocer those who buy in late. aka a mlm with extra steps which is a pyramid scheme with extra steps which is a ponzi with extra steps.,Negative
im old might not be around in 15 more years thats too long a ways out to speculate about anything. btc is the beginning the present and...lots of the future still. everything else is a gamble.,Positive
because a good portion of the alts are actually built on it. ethereum does have the first mover advantage and its actually good. wouldnt be where it is today if it didnt have both.,Positive
right ada is by far the leader when in comes to stacking. i strongly believe in this coin,Positive
half a penny baby lets go i want the new c8 corvette baby,Positive

once all bitcoins are mined the miners will have no incentive to keep validating transactions. thats when you will see bitcoins price shatter.,Negative
the network is a disaster. constantly having issues. i cant even send sol to my defi wallet because it keeps failing,Negative
the situation has not changed over the past decades. fortunately bitcoin is here to give us an alternative to this system by allowing us to take back the power over money.,Positive
the internet allows you to transfer information all around the world. bitcoin allows you to transfer money all around the world. both are amazing and revolutionary technologies.,Positive
not a chance the dumping will just get worseno burning going on either circulation supply hasnt changed by 1 coin lol,Negative
i bought bitcoin and other cryptos because i believe in them. if you dont have that feeling about your investments youre simply better off on the sidelines.,Positive
dogecoin is one of the fastest cryptos and with some of the cheapest crypto fees now. if i want to send money from america to my friend in india by westernunion it is $3 and takes 1 day. if i send dogecoin its 30 cents and max 15 minutes.,Positive
well we all will see something good related to price and security if that happens we all will be so good with that shit i am glad that i am investing for the good future.,Positive
tell them about crypto currency so they can invest in bitcoin when they go back,Positive
this is why i love red heart the bitcoin community its not just about fiat i hope ill be around and alive one day when people will say how much is that in satoshis not bothering in converting into state fiat.,Positive
come on now nobody could have known a scheme where someone says give me your dollars and ive give you a magic bean that returns 20 a year wouldnt go on forever.,Negative
blockchain is slow and expensive. it has to be slow so that transactions can be expensive. transactions have to be expensive so that they sufficiently incentivize people to stakemine and secure the network. theres no recourse in cases of fraud. its an extremely inefficient and uncompetitive system by design.,Negative

the blockchain cant even work correctly,Negative
seriously i feel like im taking crazy pills here but how is this not apparent to everyone and before cryptobros come out of the woodwork and say that i dont understand crypto i read the original whitepaper maybe a year or so after it came out and have kept reasonably well informed on crypto stuff since then. early days bitcoin was kind of interesting but it pretty quickly became apparent that it could never function as a consumer currency. if bitcoin attempted to process even 1 of the transactions that amex does in a day it would take weeks to verify a transaction. so if it cant be used a a currency wtf is it people started pointing out that gold is largely worthless except as an agreed store of value so they said well cant bitcoin be that no of course it cant. gold has physical substance and the backing of nation states its value is protected by legal and social institutions. yeah all money is fake but bitcoin is the fakest of all. at the end of the day all crypto is worthless until you can find someone to trade you actual fiat currency for it because it cant be used to fucking buy anything that means that all crypto is just a bagholder scam it works as long as the next idiot comes along to hold the bag. fundamentally it is no different from the holofoil comic book covers that almost destroyed the comics industry in the speculative bubble of the 90s except theres a level of exposure the size of a small western european country. no party lasts forever every bubble bursts time is a flat fucking circle,Negative
crypto is pure potential. it represents hope to the masses and does not discriminate. its not racist it doesnt give a hotdamn what your preferred pronoun is. its algorithmic equality. its a distupter of disrupting tech. a virtual revolution that will literally reshape the world. adoption has begun and we are further than everyone realizes. regulators will try and stop the revolution but it is too late. the downtrodden will rise. the oppressed will stand in unity. oh. and it has made me rich. not just fiat but rich with knowledge acquired learning to trade and do ta how to better budget and how to plan for my future and my childrens futures. hopefully generations to come.,Positive
tether is also backed by not much more than hope and prayers,Negative
lunc resisting very hard. i think it will pump a lot once the market turns positive.,Positive

who is still investing in this kwonartist coin,Negative
its a pretty easy win imo just gotta hold it till next btc ath and youre literally guaranteed a 10x at current prices,Positive
ten years ago i put my down payment money into bitcoin instead of real estate. its up about 1000x. bitcoins price continues to grow at a very rapid rate long term average. you see there were good reasons for bitcoins rapid rise. most of those reasons still exist. in fact today there are even more good reasons than there were 10 or 5 years ago. it is reasonable to expect the long term average growth rate of bitcoin to stay very high for the foreseeable future. real estate has significant holding costs eg taxes maintenance insurance sometimes fees interest. real estate isnt very liquid and it has extremely high transaction costs. ultimately the price of real estate and rents is limited by incomes. for example in the long run people cant pay more for mort.rent than they earn. realistically they might be able to afford 35 or 40 percent of their net income for a place to live. thus real estate prices are limited by incomes in the long run. incomes tend to barely keep up with inflation. looking at long term historical data such as caseshiller for popular real estate markets we see in fact that real estate prices barely track the rate of inflation especially when the significant holding costs are properly accounted for. bitcoin has no such limit. bitcoin has no holding costs. bitcoin is liquid. bitcoin transactions are typically very little. bitcoins price has been more than doubling every year long term average and as mentioned before can reasonably be expected to continues its rapid ascent. real estate is currently in a bubble as evidenced by the pricetoincome ratios. the current bubble will pop as the prior bubble eventually had to pop. real estate is nailed down. bitcoin can be taken with you to anywhere in the world. real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes. real estate can be confiscated. when the private keys are properly stored bitcoin cannot be confiscated. knowing all this a person would be a total idiot to purchase real estate instead of investing in bitcoin. having said that i do plan on eventually using a small fraction about 10 or 15 percent of my bitcoin holdings to buy my dream home and to pay for it with bitcoin but still end up sitting on a serious stack of sats. i have zero regrets for investing in bitcoin instead of real estate and i never will.,Positive
btc has no legitimate competition. its building a highly secure store of value. ethereum is amazing but there are countless layer 1s nipping at its heels. btc is gold while ethereum is the internet. the problem is there are countless additional internets that want a piece.,Positive
if avalanche can continue to build and bring on partnerships they will remain in the the top 15 for a while. they have a very smart team and i think they will continue to do very well.,Positive
thats bullshit. bitcoin and co. even crashed more than the indexes in the last months. no real material stands behind. only gold can help in a crash but not bitcoin.,Negative
id say dot is a worthy investment as well.,Positive
also your btc is your btc. government cannot take it from you.,Positive
lol this crash revealed terra algorithm does not work. when $luna crash like that $btc should at least drop at certain level. did the team use a single $btc for backing up its a joke,Negative
ethereum is a scam. scams are off topic in this subreddit.,Negative
its really sad that you can only see a coin that you do not have the right to cashing out for two years.,Negative
you will not loose it all dont bring up luna excuse me while i kiss the sky but wtf. dont bring up luna as a matter of fact bring it the fuck up . its the perfect example of how a top coin can be obliterated in 2 days and why hold no matter what its just stupid hodl is for btceth .,Negative
im holding 100 axax. i predict $1000$2000 by 2028.,Positive
you dont understand bitcoin. true bitcoiners will never sell it for fiat. also major lol calling fiat actual money. if you knew what money really was you would understand bitcoin is the realest and hardest form of money our planet has ever seen.,Positive
it was backed by luna... until it wasnt. the project failed. idk why people are buying do kwons bullshit again. fool me once shame on do kwon fool me twice not happening.,Negative
diversification. seems to me that it recently got enough traction that it wont die lots of young people believing in it can buy etfs more and more politicians and traditional finance people mentioning it etc. also its just cool. that said its only a tiny part of my portfolio though rising despite not paying in and im prepared for it to go to 0.,Positive
the drug dealers and dark web users and the money laundering. they really making crypto look bad.,Negative
crypto itself will implode if celsius goes down too. eth will take a beating. billions will be lost. now we know why coinbase made those announcements,Negative
munger believes the usd will fail in the next 100 years. since they understand how frail our current monetary system is its madness they cant see the valueutility of bitcoin,Positive
you guys keep repeating this doesnt make it true. doge wont have the rebounds like bitcoin because bitcoin doesnt have an endless supply,Negative
at this point all in on eth,Positive
ask tech people what they think of blockchain the vast majority of experts in both technology and finance recognize crypto is a scam. but hey a few excar salesmen and ceos that routinely get in trouble with the sec for securities fraud... they know what theyre talking about right,Negative
because its based on nothing but belief that it has a future. i think the level of risk involved the associated shilling manipulation causes people to dislike it. it could easily go to $0 tomorrow and youd be left with nothing. perhaps worth a punt though but its not as sound as other invesmtent types discussed on here.,Negative
people are using btc all over the world every day. it doesnt matter if 90 of it is held as an investment. theres a ton more transactions than there were before. btc is used as intended its used freely and getting more popular by the day.,Positive
the main point is that bitcoin lacks any ability to give you access to cash flows.,Negative
added 40m on this dip to put me at 380m. now i only need 120m more to get me to my .5b goal.,Positive
cryptocurrency is a long term investment. in this dip newbies are panic selling. which is a good thing as this is opportunity to buy low and sell high in future. its the game of patience. more you hold more you gain.,Positive
im pretty sure most of the transactions on the blockchain are an orchestrated pump and dump.,Negative
ive been buying for 8 years and it keeps going up no matter what is said and no matter how volatile it is. 8 years of that alone is proof enough for me that crypto isnt going anywhere.,Positive

beating inflation with bitcoin.,Positive
bitcoin just had a headstart and its issuance has been lower over the past years. after the merge ethereum will have both the superior technology and monetary policy and the market cap will follow at some point,Positive
you can accumulate at even better prices next week and the week after.,Positive
this is only a problem to those who dont understand the full potential of bitcoin. bitcoin is nonpermissioned nonsurveilled esp. lightning pure trade. if for whatever reason this is valuable to you you will spend your bitcoin and if bitcoin is more valuable to you than fiat you will replenish your bitcoin by buying more bitcoin. see how that works if you would rather not have some coorporation looking over your shoulder for every payment youll opt to pay in bitcoin. just saying.,Positive
whats worse is that wasnt the first post on how to make a shit coin. its like the third or fourth and the shit coin creation posts prior also pumped.,Negative
anybody who gets scammed again from this shitty coin is dumb. literally they aint got my trust anymore,Negative

being able to send funds to another country instantly feelessly and without environmental impact through a clean mobile wallet interface. and knowing that there is zero inflation on a decentralized secure network so my funds are safe from theft and inflation. gives me a warm fuzzy feeling every time.,Positive
eth is so good because it has the highest level security securing its blockchain. you also didnt mention scaling solutions in which will help along with sharding help scale ethereums. it is false to say it has reached limit you can build on top of ethereum and extend its capacity. there is a reason why redditts is choosing to have their community points secured by ethereum. its high fees are a result of so many applications and users fighting for its limited blockspace. although fees are high now i expect in 23 years once scaling solutions in mature and deliver fees will be extremely low as users will not be interacting with etheruem 1 but will be using other layers for general interaction. this is why i think eth is going to 2050kin the medium term because ppl seem to think it will be this way forever and cant look passed the immediate in short term. because ppl who want the best security will use ethereum and eventually theyll be able to do it at very very low cost. all while inherenting the security of etheruem on these l2s. it isnt zero sum and i see other blockchains beinjg widely used due to the huge amounts in of demand for blockspace but if ethereum delivers and l2s all come together then the main negative and think probably keep price down and stopping growth are fixed and i see ethereum really coming into its own esp over a 25 timeframe.,Positive
its gonna bounce back by the weekend.,Positive

bitcoin used to be an interesting tech prototype for a digital currency when that failed because it was too volatile and slow to be useful its bagholders rebranded it as digital gold to try and dump their bags. now as an investment bitcoin is functionally identical to a ponzi scheme,Negative
exactly remember the party is just getting started join before its too late.,Positive
bitcoin is just negative energy. itll never produce a dividend. i dont think its a safe heaven. if the dollar collapses i want an asset that doesnt require an internet connection. retail investors with stimulus checks stack bitcoin. governments stack gold. i see bitcoinblockchain as an amazing service but its not an asset. ups is valuable because of its shipping services not because an envelope is worth 30k. if i want to use bitcoin to transfer $10 id just buy $10 worth and transfer it. idk. i just dont see the value in it.,Negative

why would crypto help its value is shockingly unstable and they would need to convert it into cash for that money to have real liquidity. also theyve been talking about using crypto as a form of exchange for developing nations for years and it still hasnt been adopted. theres no upside to crypto as a way to send money and lots of downsides.,Negative

i would say of all the crypto currencys out there its a sad fact that we are lucky if half of them are safe investments .,Negative
as a developer yes its good in large part because of its first mover advantage. ethereum has the largest and most active community of developers by a factor of 100 i would estimate. this is a massive advantage for any technology platform. it means there is great documentation tools apis and resources that make it easy to learn and build with. got an obscure question about the feature youre building theres probably some help guide stack overflow post or youtube tutorial to answer it. and that massive developer community also makes it much easier for startups and businesses to hire engineers who already have experience and for any new skills again they can often just google the answer. thats probably not what you expected to hear. you likely wanted some analysis of tps or scalability. ethereum chose the most logical solutions for scalability a lightweight layer 1 pos system with sharding and excellent layer 2 options for high transaction throughput. and because they have been focused on that goal longer than any other project they are by far the most reliable robust and decentralized smart contract platform available.,Positive

it is a currency yet no one uses it as a currency. you cant use it to buy things around town or from major online stores. bitcoin you can especially in places like venezuela. venezuela is actually a great example of how its good for the world because it exists they can feed their family off farming in runescape rather than starve to death because of the dictatorship oppressing them.,Positive
investments are based on investing in the work of others. you have bonds which loan money to companies who make sure of those funds and pay you interest out of their profits. you have equities which invest in companies and then share in their profits. crypto doesnt have any underlying assets. theres no company doing work generating profits to generate value interest or dividends. the value is wholly based on confidence in th value of the cryptocurrency. theres no real value or work being done to convey value. because of the way it generates value its more like a ponzi scheme than an investment. because of that i dont like seeing people recommend it as an investment because theres no floor in the value. there are no assets or businesses or profits to drive the value so a serious crisis in confidence could see the value fully collapse to zero. with proper investments theres a floor the value of the underlying assets within the companies. shares may trade above that based on expectations of future success but there is a floor and you know that in any market crash your assets may become undervalued for a while but they exist as shares in tangible companies with tangible profits and assets. tldr its too close to a ponzi scheme and therere no assets or profits driving the value.,Negative

luna 2.0 is a scam too the guy is a dark degen swindler who is still trying to loot the public for a 2nd time. the governance and vesting schedule of luna 2.0 has fine print a parachute for vcs and do kwon himself. he will make money to the bank again as he skins people alive the second time. do not fall into his trap its a gamblers den and compromised judgement due to incurred loss will only make you take more irrational risks that isnt good for the mind or the soul the gig is over. cut your losses like a diseased limb live out with pride that you survived the loss. lessons are expensive in life but if you are learning or trying to help people all that effort that never be considered waste because you are giving yourself or the more unfortunate people in the world around you a second chance. for exchanges any tokens to them are just like the flow of the river. they assume no risk if the underlying economics is bad and only interested in fees...as they sell garbage to willing buyers at the current market price which is never fair ever because it is subject to change fixing or manipulation. thats how markets are made. its a wealth redistribution scheme and at its worst is printing money out of thin air.,Negative
the value of bitcoin fluctuates way too much at least for now to be useful as a replacement for cash.,Negative
wtf are you talking about those volatile stocks were among the largest market cap. they were the darlings of the pandemic. companies like netflix paypal meta etc arent your random companies. they are in the sp 500 and used to hold major shares in your common etfs. these arent some random outliers. when you look at the once top performers that is not cherrypicking. the people who are overleveraged in crypto are the same ones doing leverage in stocks. i dont understand why people want to single out crypto. a lot of volatility comes from overleveraged trading. the same suspects are driving the dump in both asset classes. why deny that,Positive
it is inevitable and now it is the best time to buy more crypto.,Positive
currency is only useful if it can be exchanged for goods and services. to an extent you can trade it to buy your local countrys currency so thats cool but mostly right now its too volatile to be reliable as a medium of exchange.,Negative

i hate this crypto garbage i made a post about paying anyone 0.001btc for convincing me about cryptos usefulness. lo an behold i have come to realise that the coins i had for past few years are actually not there.. imagine my surprise. i loaded $100 into my jaxx wallet a few years ago just because why not well thankfull it was only $100 because ofcourse i lost it. my wallet is stuck on initializing whatever that means and i cant do anything httpsibb.co7xv0nf1 never has a bank just lost my money like that. crypto is the biggest fucking scam in the universe. get out of it while you still can. update ok so winzupdatee showed me how to fix my crap assbitcoin and as promised i sent him 0.001btc as well as my fav answer from previous post dispite not being convinced. so to whoever said i wasnt going to pay up i forgive you. also this experience has only reinforced my distrust of crypto. i paid almost ten dollars to transfer like 40. thats a 25 fee lol. how the hell can anyone advocate for a service that takes more fees than private lender banks for interest yea i get it you can anonymously send money anywhere instantly but apart from this dumb excercise on reddit i cant fathom any reason or use for this especially not a store of value. all civil and polite discussions are appreciated.,Negative
in short invest in bitcoin,Positive
people have used salt seashells cigarettes etc as money. because money is what we call the good or tool that is used as money. the is used to store value. to exchange for other goods. as a unit of account. a goods or tool becomes money when it is used as money. in a prison cigarettes becomes money when that is the goods used for money. different goods or tools can be better or worse money depending on the qualities it has. there is no requirement that it has to be tangible or physical. the requirements are that is has to do its job more or less. it has to work as a store of value means of exchange unit of account and to do so it has to be fungible transportable and durable easy to verify etc. bitcoin has all those properties and is designed to excel at all of them. some say it does not store value because it is too volatile but bitcoin does not contain volatility the volatility is caused by other humans. and volatility is not a problem as long as it has remained in value or increase in value between time a and time b the volatility in between does not matter at all. so far that requires could require that you hold it for more than 24 years but it will go down and become better and when it does it becomes even more valuable as more and more people see that it is here to stay and see that they can trust that it stores value and even increase in value. so far it have and it seems like a given that it will continue to work and i would not bet against bitcoin. gold is not bad but today it does not work as a means of exchange for daily items and it probably can not as people will not go back from digital. digital is superior at saving time and being verifiable. httpswww.thoughtco.comwhatismoney1147763,Positive

great post. its so easy to make money in crypto with patience and a long time horizon. invest in sound projects during dips and plan your returns 4 years from now and not 4 weeks from now. be a patient value investor and stop trying to pick the winning numbers this isnt a lottery ticket its fundamental investing principles stop clickingreadingwatching anything that says this coin will 100x by this time stick to strong fundamentals and you will easily 34x your investments in 45 years which probably doesnt seem that sexy but is a remarkable return.,Positive
ethereum is being used in the medical field to verify vaccine passports on the blockchain i thought that one was pretty cool,Positive
i suspect that bitcoin will succeed but for none of the reasons most people talk about. bitcoin does have an inherent value. its inherent value stems from its distinct advantages it is uncontrollable and easily launderable. bitcoin is the perfect underground currency. you can sell drugs with it. you can prostitute with it. you can sell murder with it. bitcoins will have value not because it has any inherent worth but because it will be the only currency you can safely use to conduct illegal transactions. want bj on the corner of fu and lapd convert your dollars to bitcoins pay in bitcoins and presto happy ending for you the value of the bitcoin will eventually be set by the flow of money through the currency in the pursuit of illicit goods. lets say the daily illicit through transaction market is $100m. that means every day $100m worth of bitcoins are bought used to purchase illicit goods and services and then sold back into dollars. thus however many unique bitcoins happen to be on the market that day they will in total be worth $100m.,Positive

16844 crypto currencies. 80 of them are pure garbage discussion according to coin market cap there are 16844 cryptos out on the world market although coin gecko shows 12463. still thats a shitload. no wonder some of my non crypto friends think crypto is simply a penny stock market. those of us in the space know some project have very good intentions and fail. some succeed. some just hang out. but so many others are pure scam and we all know it. i guess that is the price of decentralization and i sometimes struggle with this. we dont believe in censorship so why would we be in the business of telling new projects they arent allowed because we are already too many in the room. sadly too many people will invest their life in dumb things like squid game tokens only to find no liquidity when trying to cash out. others will simply be rug pulled. the worse part is the hit we as investors and believers of fundamentals take as it creates a bad reputation and gives crypto a terrible image. if politicians and regulators should have a beef with anything about crypto its these shady scam projects but how to determine a shady scam project until it is officially a scam. many people in the crypto world still say shib for example is a scam and thats their opinion. many people not in crypto say bitcoin is a scam. many bitcoiners say ethereum is a scam and so on. so where do we go from here one critique politicians often use is crypto cant police itself when it comes to these scams and rug pulls so they need harsh and strict regulation to be enforced and penalized. how can crypto police itself when project tribes cant stand each other and all they do is throw each other trash on twitter. my hope is that in time as more and more people come in there are better educational tools for noobs to be aware of what is a fire hazard but i am not optimistic. people will do what they want to do in hopes of hitting a moon shot and some shady scammers know this so i imagine that number i typed in the title will likely reach 20000 or 250000 by the time 2022 is over.,Negative

a lot has changed actually. theres hundreds of crypto coins now and theyre all competitive with each other. most do more or less the same thing with a different name. thats a huge dilution of the customer pool. on top of that given that there are sports arenas named after crypto and multiple super bowl ads its likely that crypto has reached nearly every possible customer so i wouldnt expect much future growth of the userbase. and the vast majority of customers are looking for investment returns which have .. not been good lately. thats not great for customer retention. on top of that running the miners exchanges and ad campaigns are an enormous ongoing cost that customers need to cover in perpetuity. without some huge growth in the user base its hard to imagine things will get better from here.,Negative

technologically best is not a great standard. whatever blockchain you identify as best tech can just be literally copied or forked and the new chain with 0 track record is equally technically good. having said that best for what there are different blockchains that have some feature that distinguishes them from the rest and if that feature is the standard theyd be the best. should everybody abandon whatever the top blockchain is every time a new project comes out that is better eth is good. it was the first to do what it does has a large number of qualified developers and lots of nodes. as you say cheaper faster etc. blockchains are now out therebut whats that to all the dapps built on eth theres a lot of inertia and human effort tied up in eth smart contracts. and what if another new generation comes out next year even faster smarter cheaper etc or should we go with l2s or chains crosscompatible with other chains or focus on bridges in the end eths value has a lot to do with being first. it has a track record. millions have found it reliable. hackers have had at it. legal jurisdictions have tolerated it. any clone has a lesser track record. people are more inclined to trust such a blockchain than something shiny and new where theyd have to research the premine and inflation and developers and see if there are any new vulnerabilities that snuck into the code. bitcoin for money and ethereum for computing do pretty good against the basic requirements for money or computing. people like using what everybody uses. other chains may end up displacing btc and eth but thousands have tried and failedit wont be simply because something with better tech speed etc. came along.,Positive

its like the only stable thing on stable coins is the name. they go yeah its not really pegged to a dollar anymore but too many didnt care about it.,Negative
for me i see it as a completely speculative asset. ive bought some in the past made a bit of money off it and sold. what i dont like about it because its so immature it can be legislated to oblivion. also that it doesnt have any sizeable use cases yet other than trading it and money laundering. i cant see it becoming used as a currency as deflation inherently built into it as well as its price volatility is an impediment. also the story of store of value is weak when you consider that its price fluctuates massively unlike traditional assets. the only thing i can see is international payments but this will end up being done without needing any of the cryptos out there. no matter what the narrative i feel and believe that everyone is just holding to maximise their returns then dump their bags to someone else whos hoping to do the same. as there is no underlying asset to underpin the value of the coin other than supply and demand if demand collapses the price will as well. its open to manipulation insider trading and so forth. these have been largely regulated out of the mature stock markets while crypto is the wild west right now. its not diversified enough. a tracker find tracks thousands of companies while something like that doesnt exist in the crypto sphere to provide a notion of stability. its like investing in a super volatile stock. id be happy to speculate with some play money but its lack of regulation is putting me off from making it a primary investment choice.,Negative

this is the way. seriously. i tell everyone dont try to time it. just dollar cost average into crypto with your spare money and do that for 4 years. literally just do it for 4 years. and then look back and see how you did and i think you will be pleased.,Positive
dot is the real deal with bank level security and stability. kusama was essentially a copy of dot developed to test new updates in a real world and real economic environment before implementing on dot. it ensure dot always runs smooth and never goes down or has security breaches. most of the projects on dot will also have a sister network on kusama that will essentially do the same thing but will get new features and capabilities first. its also cheaper to use in general. kusama is turning into an art and gaming hub because of this which is really cool. so moonrivermoonbeam karuraacala heikoparallel khalaphala etc. are just the kusamadot sister networks. same teams building them the kusama versions will just have more features than the dot versions.,Positive
its a store of value and a hedge. big investors trade it like the stock market so thats why it goes up and down with the other markets. its still early it takes a long time for these things to come to fruition as people are so resistant to change,Positive
bitcoin is the first player in the decentralized crypto market and thats why it is good for people to use it but there are also many other options along with it.,Positive

its a decentralized ponzi scheme. just because no one person or entity is orchestrating it doesnt mean it doesnt have the hallmark mechanisms of a ponzi scheme. do profits come from anywhere else but new investors that is the only question needed to establish whether or not its a ponzi scheme. some of them do promise large returns. and the rest while they may not directly promise it certainly insinuate it. chanting have fun staying poor is an indirect way of asserting that you know it will go up leaving nonholders poor. the entire hodl doctrine thats pushed is the philosophy that you will make large returns if you hold long enough. dont play dumb. if its not direct promises its everything short of that. the entire subculture is built on it. and of course they do try to attract new members. why is there advertising in the super bowl on wall street in nba stadium names why do they try to orange pill friends and family,Negative

i still see a completely speculative instrument i hesitate to call it an asset with no underlying value other than the technology upon which it rests of which could be adopted rather quickly by the federal reserve banking system blockchain. i see an unregulated market that is likely to face more and more regulation both domestically and internationally as we move forward.,Negative
so many scams. hard to covert money back to fiat. relentless junk and fake emails. nft hype stupid .jpgs and celebrities exploiting the space. so many shit coins. so many pump and dumps. use cases mostly bullshit. great community mostly bullshit and in my opinion preys on those who seek a community to be involved with whilst unknowingly having their pants pulled down. horrendous fees to do literally anything with crypto. still so complicated to deal with and risks of accidentally losing your money. hodling diamond hands rockets etc. market manipulation just like the stock market. unregulated ok if thats even really true is that so great see above re scams. using fiat remains by far easier and more secure. and last but not least just losing money unless youre lucky to have been actually early you are no longer early or strike on a pump and dump early and get out at the right time. i am willing to hold until i break even and i am then getting the hell out if i can even get my sodding money somewhere i can use it after paying the tax man handsomely of course.,Negative

the problem is not so much that these thousands of cryptos dont do anything its that they all do the same thing. so many of them are just copied and pasted with little or no difference and that limits use cases for each one. the market is diluted and that means many chains will just fade into obscurity.,Negative
full audit of usdc too.,Negative
um what bitcoin is constantly being improved and evolving. taproot was pretty huge.,Positive
luna2 return of the scam.,Negative
everyone who ever wouldve invested in doge already has done so. theres no longer any bigger fools left who will buy a useless currency. its going down to 000001 dollars. trust me,Negative
lel useless ghost chain that will be dead in a few years. no one cares about ada besides ada tards,Negative
yes thats why cryptos prey on mostly poor financially illiterate people.,Negative
if you lose money a 2nd time to this mofo its on you.,Negative
you just described a pyramid scheme,Negative
i bought crypto just to surf on hype retard wave. i do not beleieve crypto to be long term investment and think vast majority people are there just for quick gains as well.,Negative
crypto as a whole needs a win. im rooting for a smooth transition.,Positive
is it zero if not then its over valued.,Negative
nows a good time to start following the news reflecting on what happen and how we got here and learning about how bitcoin could be better. if your values and opinions align then ye accumulating bitcoin slowly at lows is a very good idea.,Positive
no. why you ask do kwon stole 80k btc and causes all his retail investors to lose all their money. then he ignores community for burn and creates a new shitty coin. and youre going to buy that,Negative
gusd seems pretty safe as gemini is probably the exchange that follows the most rules. its only 6.9 apy but i wouldnt be worried about losing any money i put in to it,Positive
i came into the cryptoverse like 5 months ago waaaayy too late i know and for me it have been 5 months of constantly learning about everything from like op say blockchain the tech behind the different coins. staking and also how the banks are screwing us over all. the. fucking. time. in many generations so for me crypto is a way to try to get economically independent from the banks. why would i keep my money in the banks so they have more money to play with so they can become richer and they gives me nothing back fuck them before i entered crypto idspend money on useless things... now i think twice before spending... i am very humble and thankfully to this sub. thanks guys,Positive
crypto taught me very much too...not in crypto terms but also life in general. i stopped smoking and spending my fiat for useless stuff but learnt to be more humble thrifty and live more healthy. i am very grateful for crypto and im always happy to see others doing good too.,Positive
its only a matter of time. id spread it though 25 at 0.05 25 at 0.04 25 at 0.03 and 25 at 0.02 as bearish as that sounds i believe it will survive a true crypto winter that many alts wont..,Positive
cant go wrong with eth,Positive
i used to despise bitcoin cash now i dont and actually see the value in it. this is why politics i used to think that bitcoin cash was a traitor and to be avoided at all costs. i thought how can anyone trust an ecosystem if bitcoin the 1 coin that everyone holds and believes in ends up being dethroned why would anyone invest in this space if king btc is no more these were my thoughts in 2017 up until just the other day... now i have come to terms that bch is not just a copy and paste clone of bitcoin. every single bitcoin holder on the planet received an equal amount of bitcoin cash because it was a forked from bitcoin. this means that even if bitcoin cash became the 1 cryptocurrency that bitcoin holders have no one to blame but themselves if they dont own an equal portion of bitcoin cash... it was given to them for free i guess the more and more i have thought about it bitcoin cash is bitcoin because it has the same previous transaction history and literally everyone holding bitcoin received an equal amount of bitcoin cash this was no money grab. bitcoin may or may not scale with its small blocksize. we should be thanking bitcoin cash for being created to give a counter argument to see if increasing the blocksize ends up being good for scalability and fees. and if it ends up being the 1 cryptocurrency because of this who cares everyone holding bitcoin during the time of the fork holds an equal amount of bitcoin cash and if they dont then that is on them. not sure why it took me 3 years to have this epiphany but i did and wanted to share. what are your thoughts on bitcoin cash,Positive
there is no demand tho lol bitcoin has no actual value,Negative
i dont think so crypto recover . all coins going down and down,Negative
ive posted this before but regulation particularly around stablecoins would be so good for crypto. we arent going to see widespread adoption until there is more regulation in place and a safer playground for more risk averse people and institutions to live within. this can live in harmony with crypto as it is today. this of course does assume that the regulations are done intelligently which is definitely not a given. but i do think it has a solid chance of happening. theres enough money in crypto with folks like the winklevii and armstrong that will push the regulation in the right direction.,Positive
ethereum is good and not just because it has the first mover advantage. it has managed to sustain a community of other projects built around it which is actually genius. sure the gas fees are a pain and l2 might actually be accomplished way down the line but this doesnt negate its abilityprogress or how good a project it really is. to be 2nd to bitcoin is no small fit if it were litecoin and ripple will be where it is today. my advise stack as much eth as you can the market is wobbly now for sure but guess what its still early days and it is you who stacks thats the beneficiary of that first movers advantage being discussed. at rpbtonline we share a lot of insights about the markets and how you can stack ether eth. learn and stack as much as you can while you can. cheers.,Positive
this is excellent news for bitcoin,Positive
not a store of value not a currency not a hedge against money printer what is it i just want to understand current understanding aside from lowest effort ponzi scam but truly i am at loss to understand and explain what function does bitcoin solve or is solving because its also carbon negative toxic because coal mines are now running some mining operations and that sounds positively awful and very much seems like bitcoin is digital cigarette blowing fumes to plebs while letting easy cheap energy sources become stronghold for even more authoritarian rules russia kazakhstan etc so what do you think is the point of bitcoin aside from speculative bubble it looks like elaborate tulip mania the longer we dont answer them,Negative
im long on btc in general because there is a lot of institutional money in it now. theres been less retail investors but theres a lot of big finance money in btc and crypto in general that i dont think it will completely go to 0. if i had a lot of liquid cash i would splash on some altcoins at really low value and hold for the next 35 yrs.,Positive
ts a hustle its not an investment. you only have to look at the way its portrayed on social media where its pumped with all the enthusiasm that travelling salesmen used to peddle snake oil in olden days. its a gamble where you hope to find some mug willing to pay more for it than you did and youre not the one that is left holding the bag. it has no intrinsic value and despite all the white papers in the world it doesnt do what it says on the tin. people who have it have it purely for convincing an idiot to pay more than they did. people argue how the coins are currencies and how its all decentralised money yet they constantly do nothing but compare the value of the crypto they own to fiat currencies because basically it has no purpose and outside of true stablecoins which at least can be used for a cheap way to transfer money without the risk of their value changing 10 within seconds because of its volatility never will. i own crypto but at least im honest and say the reason i do it is because of the sole purpose of hoping that the money thats in other peoples pockets ends up in mine. i dont bullshit like far to many do especially those investing in meme coins like doge and shib.,Negative
ill buy another 100 bucks worth,Positive
dogecoin is plain and simple payment method crypto. nothing fancy or overly complicated. anyone can understand it. this is its greatest strength,Positive
tether. its sort of an open secret they dont have enough funds it will crash eventually and its going to take everything down big time.,Negative
same here. used to throw 50 of my paychecks into crypto from 20182020. no one believed that i went from 5k to my name to 500k in crypto at the all time high. you dont need to believe in math it just works people. anyway i quit my job in 2020 and i wish you can soon as well.,Positive
bitcoin is hope love. many people are buying and investing long for their kids grand kids neices and nephews. its hope and love for them. red heart,Positive
bitcoin is younggive it some timegive it a chanceyou wont be sorry .,Positive
ive found that nearly all coins are either useless or are only there to serve a purpose or problem that the other coins themselves create. like governance tokens dont need those if no crypto. proctopcs where you can lend crypto so others can borrow crypto so they can ... buy crypto. its a nearly fully selfreferential and closed loop system. i realed that got ros of all ambitions and dreams about it and just be a cold blooded trader. it helped.,Negative
i have buy orders spread across $750 $1300. bear market game accumulate.,Positive
if its supposed to act as a currency it kinda sucks at it,Negative
1000000 correct xrp is pure speculation and zero delivery.,Negative
more like 99.9. out of 20000 coins thats 20. im still being very generous. my honest belief is that about 5 coins have actual utility.,Negative
just buy it now and forget about it. trust the process.,Positive
think the hype gone now we stuck holding bags,Negative
i didnt invest in xrp when it crashed because it was a much riskier option than other projects at the time. doesnt make sense to invest into something that is having issues. almost all cryptos are going to go up in a bull market. i dont feel bad at all for not investing in xrp. not one bit.,Negative
algo is one of the best and should be top 5.,Positive
crypto has changed all of our lives. if were on here were interested enough in crypto to have most likely invested in it. some may be better than others but im just glad we have a space where we can all talk about cryptocurrency with crypto enthusiasts.,Positive
i am holding some paxg purely as it normally goes up when the rest goes down it is good to diversify your portfolio with commodities you can get interest on paxg im getting 6 interest at nexo,Positive
ethereum will be the biggest letdown in crypto history.,Negative
lightning network has the capability to do millions of $btc transactions a sec with near to 0 fees. 3,Positive
it means there will be more daily volume which means more daily active users which means more positive price action in the long run.,Positive
the exchanges were so irresponsible to list these tokens. luna shouldve been allowed to die,Negative
massive ecosystem. pretty much all applications and a shitload of developers in crypto are on ethereum and pretty much all applications on other chains are forks of what has been developed on ethereum which says a lot. just look at the top 100 cryptocurrencies how many of them are tokens on ethereum a majority decentralization and safety. ethereum could have lower fees by sacrificing decentralization like many other chains do but they dont skimp on these values and in doing so they put safety first. and even if ethereum did sacrifice decentralization it only goes so far and it is something all chains will face once users increase. solution to the scalability trilemma. ethereums solution is rollups and sharding rollups are being implemented right now and haswill drastically decrease fees sharding will plummet them even further whenever it arrives. the future is that people dont use layer 1 on ethereum but use the rollups on layer 2 you can preview this by buying eth on crypto.com withdrawing onto arbitrum still quite high fees while in beta and use on curve finance just like you would with ethereum layer 1 or avalanche.,Positive
im actually excited because i had cash on the side for moments like this.,Positive
